	abstract = {ObjectivesEvidence-based smoking cessation support tools (EBSTs) can double the quitting chances, but uptake among smokers is low. A digital decision aid (DA) could help smokers choose an EBST in concordance with their values and preferences, but it is unclear which type of smokers are interested in a digital DA. We hypothesized that smokers? general decision-making style (GDMS) could be used to identify early adopters. This study therefore aimed to identify smoker profiles based on smokers? GDMS and investigate these profiles? association with intention to use a digital DA.DesignA cross-sectional dataset (N?=?200 smokers intending to quit) was used to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis based on smokers? GDMS scores.MethodsClusters were compared on demographic and socio-cognitive variables. Mediation analyses were conducted to see if the relationship between cluster membership and intention was mediated through socio-cognitive variables (e.g., attitude).ResultsTwo clusters were identified; ?Avoidant Regretters? (n?=?134) were more avoidant, more regretful and tended to depend more on others in their decision making, while ?Intuitive Non-regretters? (n?=?66) were more spontaneous and intuitive in their decision making. Cluster membership was significantly related to intention to use a DA, with ?Avoidant Regretters? being more interested. Yet, this association ceased to be significant when corrected for socio-cognitive variables (e.g., attitude). This indicates that cluster membership affected intention via socio-cognitive variables.ConclusionsThe GDMS can be used to identify smokers who are interested in a digital DA early on. As such, the GDMS can be used to tailor recruitment and DA content.},

	abstract = {Background: Decision aids (DAs) may be used to facilitate an autonomous, informed decision to cease smoking and promote the uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance (ie, behavioral support, nicotine replacement therapy, or prescription medication). However, knowledge is lacking regarding their effective elements and (cost-)effectiveness. Objective: We describe the development process of an online DA (called “VISOR”) that helps smokers to choose evidence-based cessation assistance. Additionally, we provide a description of the protocol of an ongoing randomized controlled trial in which the DA containing an explicit value clarification method (VCM) and tailored advice is compared with a DA without an explicit VCM and tailored advice. Methods: The development of “VISOR” was based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards guidelines. Viewpoints of end users (collected through 20 interviews with smokers) and clinical and scientific experts (assessed using 2 Delphi studies with 24 scientists and 38 clinicians) were assessed regarding cessation tool decision making and preferred DA content. These findings, together with principles from the Self-Determination Theory, served as input for the development of the online DA. A first DA prototype was alpha-tested in September 2019 and beta-tested for usability in December 2019; feedback was incorporated and resulted in a final version. The final DA contains (1) an information section, (2) an optional knowledge quiz, (3) a brief smoking assessment, (4) intuitive decision, (5) intermediate advice, (6) an explicit VCM, (7) tailored advice, and (8) access information. A randomized controlled trial is currently being conducted to assess the DA’s (cost-)effectiveness compared to a DA that does not include the explicit VCM and the tailored advice; specifically, the DA’s effect on smoking abstinence, uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance, smoking abstinence mediated through uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance, and decisional conflict are investigated. Participants are randomly allocated to receive access to 1 of the 2 DAs and are asked to complete 5 questionnaires (including the baseline questionnaire) over a period of 12 months. To evaluate the effects of the DA on the outcome measures, logistic and linear regression analyses as well as mediation analyses will be carried out. An economic evaluation will be performed to assess the cost-effectiveness. Results: Data regarding the effect of the VISOR DA are currently being collected, and data collection is expected to be concluded in 2021. Conclusions: By making use of an iterative process that integrated different stakeholders’ perspectives (including end users), we were able to systematically design an evidence-based DA. The study will contribute to the current knowledge regarding smoking cessation DA application, the added value of explicit VCMs, and the effect of behavioral and informed decision-making outcomes.

	abstract = {Introduction: Evidence-based cessation assistance is known to increase cessation rates. Activating personal preferences as part of the decision for smoking cessation assistance tools could further improve tools' effectiveness. Decision aids (DAs) help individuals to choose amongst the various options by taking these preferences into account and, therefore, could have a positive effect on cessation rates. To develop attractive and effective DAs, potential end users' needs, and experts' viewpoints should be considered during development processes. Therefore, the aim of this study was: (1) To explore smokers' needs and viewpoints regarding a smoking cessation assistance DA, and (2) to obtain consensus among smoking cessation counsellors and scientific experts about the content and format of such a DA. Materials and methods: Data was gathered via two approaches applied across three studies: (1) 20 semi-structured interviews with potential end users, (2) two three-round Delphi studies with 61 smoking cessation counsellors and 44 scientific experts. Data from the interviews and the first round of the Delphi studies were analysed qualitatively using the Framework method, while data from the second and third round of the Delphi studies were analysed quantitatively using medians and interquartile ranges. Results: Potential end users reported to acquire information in different ways: Via own experiences, their social environment, and the media. Important characteristics to decide between tools also varied, however effectiveness and costs were commonly reported as the most important characteristics. The experts reached consensus on 38 and 40 statements (respectively) regarding important cessation assistance tools' characteristics and their viewpoints on a smoking cessation assistance DA, e.g., that a tool should be appropriate for users' level of addiction. Discussion and conclusion: Some clear trends emerged among the potential end users (especially regarding important characteristics). Experts also reached consensus among a number of statements. However, there was some variation in the needs and wishes among the (different) stakeholders. The combination of these studies highlights that a 'one size fits all' approach is not desirable. In the development of DAs, this heterogeneity should be taken into account, e.g., by enabling users to customize a DA based on their personal preferences while safeguarding essential elements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant from the Dutch Cancer Society (UM2015-7744).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Evaluation of this project by the Medical Ethics Committee METC Z (16-N-227) revealed that this project did not require medical ethics approval under the rules of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO).All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Objective
To broadly synthesize literature regarding decision aids (DAs) supporting decision making about diet, physical activity, sleeping and substance use a scoping review was performed.
Methods
Multiple sources were used: (1) Scientific literature searches, (2) excluded references from a Cochrane review regarding DAs for treatments and screenings, and (3) results from additional searches. Interventions had to (1) support informed decision making and (2) provide information and help to choose between at least two options. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts. Relevant information was extracted descriptively.
Results
Thirty-five scientific articles and four DAs (grey literature) were included. Results were heterogeneous. Twenty-nine (94\%) studies described substance use DAs. All DAs offered information and value and/or preference clarification. Many other elements were included (e.g., goal-setting). DA’s effects were mixed. Few studies used standardized measures, e.g., decisional conflict (n = 4, 13\%). Some positive behavioral effects were reported: e.g., smoking abstinence (n = 1).
Conclusions
This research shows only some positive behavioral effects of DAs. However, studies reported heterogeneous results/outcomes, impeding knowledge synthesis. Areas of improvement were identified, e.g., establishing which intervention elements are effective regarding health behavior decision making.
Practice implications
DAs can potentially be beneficial in supporting people to change health behaviors – especially regarding smoking.},

	abstract = {People make numerous health-related choices each day: For example, deciding to brush one’s teeth or to eat well and healthy – or not to do these activities. To support complex decisions and subsequent behaviour change, both Behaviour Change Interventions (BCIs) and Patient Decision Aids (PtDAs) have been developed and evolved independently to support people in health-related decision making. In this paper, we critically review BCIs and PtDAs, examine their similarities and differences, and identify potential for integration of expertise to increase the benefits for people engaging with healthcare and health behaviours. The two approaches appear to mainly differ in terms of their (1) goals and foci, (2) theoretical basis, (3) development frameworks, (4) active ingredients and (5) effect evaluation. To facilitate the integration of scientific insights from these two fields, we recommend to (1) bring both fields together and promote interprofessional discussions, (2) train (health) professionals to recognise strengths of both approaches, (3) investigate the synergy of the two fields, (4) be prepared for and try to mitigate a culture shock when the fields start to interact. Knowledge generated by researching PtDAs could be used to facilitate decisional processes that enable patients to choose goals that are in line with their values and preferences, while insights from researching BCIs could be used to facilitate engagement with, and implementation of those goals. This integration could allow researchers and intervention providers to increase the benefits for people engaging with healthcare and health behaviours.},

Deciding if, and how, to purse their child wish can be a demanding process. This study aims to describe the reproductive joint decision-making process of genetically at-risk couples. A qualitative study was conducted with 16 couples (N=31) at risk of transmitting a genetic disease to their offspring and who received genetic counseling. Most couples were not aware of all available reproductive options in the Netherlands. A variety of motives was reported with almost all couples expressing a preference towards a reproductive option in which the child is genetically related to both parents. Only a few couples considered other options such as the use of donor gametes, adoption, and foster parenting. All couples indicated that they had multiple conversations to reach a mutually supported reproductive decision. Several carriers reported feelings of guilt and in some couples, the woman appeared to have a greater impact in the decision-making process as she should carry a pregnancy and should undergo medical treatments. This study provides insight in the extensive decision-making process of genetically at-risk couples and the role of both partners in this process. These findings can guide the development of genetic counseling (e.g., increase awareness of available reproductive options) and decision support for these couples.},

	abstract = {Background: Smoking continues to be a driver of mortality. Various forms of evidence-based cessation assistance exist; however, their use is limited. The choice between them may also induce decisional conflict. Offering decision aids (DAs) may be beneficial; however, insights into their effective elements are lacking. Objective: This study tested the added value of an effective element (ie, an “explicit value clarification method” paired with computer-tailored advice indicating the most fitting cessation assistance) of a web-based smoking cessation DA. Methods: A web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted among smokers motivated to stop smoking within 6 months. The intervention group received a DA with the aforementioned elements, and the control group received the same DA without these elements. The primary outcome measure was 7-day point prevalence abstinence 6 months after baseline (time point 3 [t=3]). Secondary outcome measures were 7-day point prevalence of abstinence 1 month after baseline (time point 2 [t=2]), evidence-based cessation assistance use (t=2 and t=3), and decisional conflict (immediately after DA; time point 1). Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to assess the outcomes. Analyses were conducted following 2 (decisional conflict) and 3 (smoking cessation) outcome scenarios: complete cases, worst-case scenario (assuming that dropouts still smoked), and multiple imputations. A priori sample size calculation indicated that 796 participants were needed. The participants were mainly recruited on the web (eg, social media). All the data were self-reported. Results: Overall, 2375 participants were randomized (intervention n=1164, 49.01\%), of whom 599 (25.22\%; intervention n=275, 45.91\%) completed the DAs, and 276 (11.62\%; intervention n=143, 51.81\%), 97 (4.08\%; intervention n=54, 55.67\%), and 103 (4.34\%; intervention n=56, 54.37\%) completed time point 1, t=2, and t=3, respectively. More participants stopped smoking in the intervention group (23/63, 37\%) than in the control group (14/52, 27\%) after 6 months; however, this was only statistically significant in the worst-case scenario (crude P=.02; adjusted P=.04). Effects on the secondary outcomes were only observed for smoking abstinence after 1 month (15/55, 27\%, compared with 7/46, 15\%, in the crude and adjusted models, respectively; P=.02) and for cessation assistance uptake after 1 month (26/56, 46\% compared with 18/47, 38\% only in the crude model; P=.04) and 6 months (38/61, 62\% compared with 26/50, 52\%; crude P=.01; adjusted P=.02) but only in the worst-case scenario. Nonuse attrition was 34.19\% higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Currently, we cannot confidently recommend the inclusion of explicit value clarification methods and computer-tailored advice. However, they might result in higher nonuse attrition rates, thereby limiting their potential. As a lack of statistical power may have influenced the outcomes, we recommend replicating this study with some adaptations based on the lessons learned.
