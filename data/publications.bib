	abstract = {Purpose 

To measure the impact of a change in grading system in the first two years of medical school, from graded (A, B, C, D, F) to pass/fail, on medical students’ academic performance, attendance, residency match, satisfaction, and psychological well-being.

Method

For both the graded and pass/fail classes, objective data were collected on academic performance in the first- and second-year courses, the clerkships, United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Steps 1 and 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and residency placement. Self-report data were collected using a Web survey (which included the Dupuy General Well-Being Schedule) administered each of the first four semesters of medical school. The study was conducted from 2002 to 2007 at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.

Results

The pass/fail class exhibited a significant increase in well-being during each of the first three semesters of medical school relative to the graded class, greater satisfaction with the quality of their medical education during the first four semesters of medical school, and greater satisfaction with their personal lives during the first three semesters of medical school. The graded and pass/fail classes showed no significant differences in performance in first- and second-year courses, grades in clerkships, scores on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2CK, success in residency placement, and attendance at academic activities.

Conclusions

A change in grading from letter grades to pass/fail in the first two years of medical school conferred distinct advantages to medical students, in terms of improved psychological well-being and satisfaction, without any reduction in performance in courses or clerkships, USMLE test scores, success in residency placement, or level of attendance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To objectively measure the effect of a pass-fail grading system on stress, mood, group cohesion, and test anxiety in medical students.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Beginning with the class of 2006, the Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minn, changed the grading system for first-year courses from a 5-interval grading system to a pass-fail grading system. Students in the previous class of 2005, who were graded using a 5-interval system during their first year of medical school, were compared with students in the class of 2006. Using a prospective study design, the 2 groups were compared at the end of both the first year and the second year of medical school on the Perceived Stress Scale, Profile of Mood States, Perceived Cohesion Scale, Test Anxiety Inventory, and (after year 2) the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1. Data collection occurred in 2002 and 2003 with the class of 2005 and in 2003 and 2004 with the class of 2006.
RESULTS
Students graded with the pass-fail system had less perceived stress (median, 15.0 vs 21.0; P=.01) and greater group cohesion (median, 34.5 vs 30.0; P=.02) at the end of their second year of coursework than their 5-interval graded peers. The pass-fail group had better mood (median, 46.5) than the graded group (median, 64.0), but this difference was not statistically significant (P=.07). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in test-taking anxiety or in United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 board scores.
CONCLUSION
Pass-fail grading may reduce stress and increase group cohesion in medical students compared with traditional 5-interval grading.},

ICT skills are becoming increasingly relevant in every context, especially in the workplace, therefore one of the prime objectives for universities has become preparing future professionals to be able to deal with problems and search for solutions, including digital competence as a vital skill set. Different policies, initiatives and strategies are currently being proposed in Germany, addressing educational technology innovations in HE. The University of Oldenburg is presented as an example, in an endeavour to gain an understanding of what is being proposed and what is actually happening in teaching and learning in German university classrooms. Two datasets were examined regarding the use and perceptions of students (n = 200) and teachers (n = 381) on the use of digital tools. Findings reveal that both teachers and students use a limited number of digital technology for predominantly assimilative tasks, with the Learning Management System being perceived as the most useful tool. In order to support the broader use of educational technology for teaching and learning purposes, strategies for HE institutions are suggested.},

	abstract = {ObjectivesEvidence-based smoking cessation support tools (EBSTs) can double the quitting chances, but uptake among smokers is low. A digital decision aid (DA) could help smokers choose an EBST in concordance with their values and preferences, but it is unclear which type of smokers are interested in a digital DA. We hypothesized that smokers? general decision-making style (GDMS) could be used to identify early adopters. This study therefore aimed to identify smoker profiles based on smokers? GDMS and investigate these profiles? association with intention to use a digital DA.DesignA cross-sectional dataset (N?=?200 smokers intending to quit) was used to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis based on smokers? GDMS scores.MethodsClusters were compared on demographic and socio-cognitive variables. Mediation analyses were conducted to see if the relationship between cluster membership and intention was mediated through socio-cognitive variables (e.g., attitude).ResultsTwo clusters were identified; ?Avoidant Regretters? (n?=?134) were more avoidant, more regretful and tended to depend more on others in their decision making, while ?Intuitive Non-regretters? (n?=?66) were more spontaneous and intuitive in their decision making. Cluster membership was significantly related to intention to use a DA, with ?Avoidant Regretters? being more interested. Yet, this association ceased to be significant when corrected for socio-cognitive variables (e.g., attitude). This indicates that cluster membership affected intention via socio-cognitive variables.ConclusionsThe GDMS can be used to identify smokers who are interested in a digital DA early on. As such, the GDMS can be used to tailor recruitment and DA content.},

	abstract = {Background. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are effective interventions to support patient involvement in health care decisions, but there is little use in practice. Our study aimed to determine subsequent PtDA use in clinical practice following published randomized controlled trials. Design. A descriptive study using an e-mail-embedded questionnaire survey targeting authors of 133 trials included in Cochrane Reviews of PtDAs (106 authors). We classified PtDA level of use as a) implementation, defined as integrating within care processes; b) dissemination to target users with planned strategies; and c) diffusion, defined as passive, unplanned spread. We conducted content analysis to identify barriers and enablers guided by the Ottawa Model of Research Use. Results. Ninety-eight authors responded (92.5\%) on 108 trialed PtDAs. Reported levels of use were implementation (n = 29; 28\%), dissemination to target user(s) (n = 9; 9\%), and diffusion (n = 7; 7\%); 57 (55\%) reported no uptake, and 1 had no response (1\%). Barriers to use in clinical practice were identified at the level of researchers (e.g., lack of posttrial plan), PtDAs (e.g., outdated, delivery mechanism), clinicians (e.g., disagreed with PtDA use), and practice environment (e.g., infrastructure support; funding). Enablers were online delivery, organizational endorsement (e.g., professional organization, charity, government), and design for and integration into the care process. Limitations. Self-report bias and potential for recall bias. Conclusions. Only 44\% of PtDA trial authors indicated some level of subsequent use following their trial. The most commonly reported barriers were lack of funding, outdated PtDAs, and clinician disagreement with PtDA use. To improve subsequent use, researchers should codesign PtDAs with end users to ensure fit with clinical practice and develop an implementation plan. National systems (e.g., platforms, endorsement, funding) can enable use.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Decision aids (DAs) may be used to facilitate an autonomous, informed decision to cease smoking and promote the uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance (ie, behavioral support, nicotine replacement therapy, or prescription medication). However, knowledge is lacking regarding their effective elements and (cost-)effectiveness. Objective: We describe the development process of an online DA (called “VISOR”) that helps smokers to choose evidence-based cessation assistance. Additionally, we provide a description of the protocol of an ongoing randomized controlled trial in which the DA containing an explicit value clarification method (VCM) and tailored advice is compared with a DA without an explicit VCM and tailored advice. Methods: The development of “VISOR” was based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards guidelines. Viewpoints of end users (collected through 20 interviews with smokers) and clinical and scientific experts (assessed using 2 Delphi studies with 24 scientists and 38 clinicians) were assessed regarding cessation tool decision making and preferred DA content. These findings, together with principles from the Self-Determination Theory, served as input for the development of the online DA. A first DA prototype was alpha-tested in September 2019 and beta-tested for usability in December 2019; feedback was incorporated and resulted in a final version. The final DA contains (1) an information section, (2) an optional knowledge quiz, (3) a brief smoking assessment, (4) intuitive decision, (5) intermediate advice, (6) an explicit VCM, (7) tailored advice, and (8) access information. A randomized controlled trial is currently being conducted to assess the DA’s (cost-)effectiveness compared to a DA that does not include the explicit VCM and the tailored advice; specifically, the DA’s effect on smoking abstinence, uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance, smoking abstinence mediated through uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance, and decisional conflict are investigated. Participants are randomly allocated to receive access to 1 of the 2 DAs and are asked to complete 5 questionnaires (including the baseline questionnaire) over a period of 12 months. To evaluate the effects of the DA on the outcome measures, logistic and linear regression analyses as well as mediation analyses will be carried out. An economic evaluation will be performed to assess the cost-effectiveness. Results: Data regarding the effect of the VISOR DA are currently being collected, and data collection is expected to be concluded in 2021. Conclusions: By making use of an iterative process that integrated different stakeholders’ perspectives (including end users), we were able to systematically design an evidence-based DA. The study will contribute to the current knowledge regarding smoking cessation DA application, the added value of explicit VCMs, and the effect of behavioral and informed decision-making outcomes.

	abstract = {Most primary care clinicians lack the skills and resources to offer effective lifestyle and medication (L\&amp;M) counseling to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Thus, effective and feasible CHD prevention programs are needed for typical practice settings.To assess the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of a combined L\&amp;M intervention to reduce CHD risk offered in counselor-delivered and web-based formats.A comparative effectiveness trial in 5 diverse family medicine practices in North Carolina. Participants were established patients, aged 35 to 79 years, with no known cardiovascular disease, and at moderate to high risk for CHD (10-year Framingham Risk Score [FRS], ≥10\%).Participants were randomized to counselor-delivered or web-based format, each including 4 intensive and 3 maintenance sessions. After randomization, both formats used a web-based decision aid showing potential CHD risk reduction associated with L\&amp;M risk-reducing strategies. Participants chose the risk-reducing strategies they wished to follow.The primary outcome was within-group change in FRS at 4-month follow-up. Other measures included standardized assessments of blood pressure, blood lipid levels, lifestyle behaviors, and medication adherence. Acceptability and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 12 months.Of 2274 screened patients, 385 were randomized (192 counselor; 193 web): mean age, 62 years; 24\% African American; and mean FRS, 16.9\%. Follow-up at 4 and 12 months included 91\% and 87\% of the randomized participants, respectively. There was a sustained reduction in FRS at both 4 months (primary outcome) and 12 months for both counselor-based (−2.3\% [95\% CI, −3.0\% to −1.6\%] and −1.9\% [95\% CI, −2.8\% to −1.1\%], respectively) and web-based groups (−1.5\% [95\% CI, −2.2\% to −0.9\%] and −1.7\% [95\% CI, −2.6\% to −0.8\%] respectively). At 4 months, the adjusted difference in FRS between groups was −1.0\% (95\% CI, −1.8\% to −0.1\%) (P = .03), and at 12 months, it was −0.6\% (95\% CI, −1.7\% to 0.5\%) (P = .30). The 12-month costs from the payer perspective were \$207 and \$110 per person for the counselor- and web-based interventions, respectively.Both intervention formats reduced CHD risk through 12-month follow-up. The web format was less expensive.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01245686},

Decision tools encourage behaviour change but their effectiveness when used in shared decision-making with health professionals (HPs) is unknown.Aim To test the feasibility of using a novel, paper-based tool for shared decision-making in initiating behaviour change.Design \&amp; setting A feasibility study in five general practices in Northern Ireland.Method Adults with, or at high risk of, CVD were invited to discuss their diet and physical activity (PA) with an HP. Using a paper-based decision aid in shared decision-making about behaviour change, their capabilities, opportunities, and motivation were considered. Diet and PA were assessed at baseline, 1, and 3 months using the Dietary Instrument for Nutritional Education (DINE) and the Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ); accelerometers measured PA at baseline and 3 months. Semi-structured interviews, analysed thematically, explored participants’ and HPs’ views of the process.Results The positive response rate to study invitation was 28\% (45/162); 23 were recruited (aged 43–74 years; 50\% male; \&lt;40\% met diet or PA recommendations); and 87\% (20/23) completed the study. All interviewees valued the tool’s structure, succinct content, and facilitation of discussion. HPs’ sharing of relevant personal experience encouraged behaviour change; social responsibilities, health conditions, and beliefs restricted change. HPs’ workloads prohibited the tool’s routine use.Conclusion Recruitment and completion rates suggest that using a novel, paper-based tool in shared decision-making for behaviour change is feasible. HPs’ workloads constrain its use in practice, but qualitative findings indicate its potential value. Cross-sector collaborative exploration of sustainable models to promote behaviour change is needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Values clarification is a recommended element of patient decision aids. Many different values clarification methods exist, but there is little evidence synthesis available to guide design decisions. PURPOSE: To describe practices in the field of explicit values clarification methods according to a taxonomy of design features. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, all EBM Reviews, CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar, manual search of reference lists, and expert contacts. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they described 1 or more explicit values clarification methods. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data about decisions addressed; use of theories, frameworks, and guidelines; and 12 design features. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 110 articles describing 98 explicit values clarification methods. Most of these addressed decisions in cancer or reproductive health, and half addressed a decision between just 2 options. Most used neither theory nor guidelines to structure their design. "Pros and cons" was the most common type of values clarification method. Most methods did not allow users to add their own concerns. Few methods explicitly presented tradeoffs inherent in the decision, supported an iterative process of values exploration, or showed how different options aligned with users' values. LIMITATIONS: Study selection criteria and choice of elements for the taxonomy may have excluded values clarification methods or design features. CONCLUSIONS: Explicit values clarification methods have diverse designs but can be systematically cataloged within the structure of a taxonomy. Developers of values clarification methods should carefully consider each of the design features in this taxonomy and publish adequate descriptions of their designs. More research is needed to study the effects of different design features.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last 10 years, there has been a major growth in the development of treatment decision aids. Multiple goals have been identified for these tools. However, the rationale for and meaning of these goals at the conceptual level, the mechanisms through which decision aids are intended to achieve these goals, and value assumptions underlying the design of aids and associated values clarification exercises have often not been made explicit. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present ideas to help inform the future development and evaluation of decision aids. RESULTS: We suggest, (i) that the appropriateness of using any decision aid be assessed within the context of the wider decision-making encounter within which it is embedded; (ii) that goal setting activities drive measurement activities and not the other way round; (iii) that the rationale for and meaning of goals at the conceptual level, and mechanisms through which they are intended to have an impact be clearly thought through and made explicit; (iv) that value assumptions underlying both decision aids and associated values clarification exercises be communicated to patients; (v) that taxonomies developed and used to classify various types of decision aids include a section on value assumptions underlying each tool; (vi) that further debate and discussion take place on the role of explicit values clarification exercises as a component of or adjunct to treatment decision aids and the feasibility of implementing valid measures. CONCLUSION: Further debate and discussion is needed on the above issues.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Empirical literature on patient decision role preferences regarding treatment and screening was reviewed to summarize patients’ role preferences across measures, time and patient population.
Methods
Five databases were searched from January 1980 to December 2007 (1980–2007 Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsychInfo, Web of Science and PubMed (2005–2007)). Eligible studies measured patient decision role preferences, described measures, presented findings as percentages or mean scores and were published in English from any country. Studies were compared by patient population, time of publication, and measure.
Results
115 studies were eligible. The majority of patients preferred sharing decisions with physicians in 63\% of the studies. A time trend appeared. The majority of respondents preferred sharing decision roles in 71\% of the studies from 2000 and later, compared to 50\% of studies before 2000. Measures themselves, in addition to patient population, influenced the preferred decision roles reported.
Conclusion
Findings appear to vary with the measure of preferred decision making used, time of the publication and characteristics of the population.
Practice implications
The role preference measure itself must be considered when interpreting patient responses to a measure or question about a patient's preference for decision roles.},

GPs find it difficult to assimilate multiple risk factors into an accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk. In addition, communicating cardiovascular risk to patients has proved to be difficult.AimsImproving primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care by enhancing patient involvement in the use of a decision support tool. Design Cluster randomized trial.MethodsThirty-four GPs included patients (40-75 years old) without CVD. In an interactive, small group training session lasting 4h, the GPs in the intervention group were trained to use the guidelines on cardiovascular risk and a decision support tool. The control group received educational materials about the guidelines on paper. GPs? clinical performance and patients? risk perception and self-reported lifestyles were measured at baseline and after 6 months. Results Thirty-four GPs recorded 490 consultations, 276 in the intervention and 214 in the control group. After 6 months, no significant effect of the intervention on the GPs? performance or the patients? risk perception was found. There was only an effect on self-reported lifestyle, in that more men in the intervention group than in the control group increased their physical activity (odds ratio 3.8, 95\% confidence interval 1.7?8.7).ConclusionThe 4-h interactive, small group training did not guarantee correct application of the decision support tool and as such failed to improve GPs? performance or correct patients? risk perception.

	abstract = {Objective
A patient decision aid (PtDA), was developed to support breast cancer patients making choices about their aftercare. The aim of this pilot was to test the effects of the PtDA on Shared Decision Making (SDM), Decision Evaluation (DES) in patients, consultation time, choice of aftercare and hospital costs.
Methods
A prospective before-and-after study including a control (no PtDA-usage) and experimental group (PtDA-usage during consultation) was conducted in six hospitals. Patients were offered a choice between intensive (face-to-face consultations) and less intensive (telephonic or on demand consultations) aftercare. All patients filled out three validated questionnaires (baseline (T0), directly after the consultation (T1), three months later (T2)), assessing demographics (T0), SDM(T1) and DES (T1, T2). Hospital costs and choice of aftercare were assessed from the patients' files (T2). Effect sizes ( ɳp2: 0.01 = small; 0.06 = medium; 0.14 = large; φ: 0.1 = small, 0.3 = medium, 0.5 = large) and p-values were calculated using both univariate and multivariate GLMs, a repeated measures GLM and chi-square-tests.
Results
A small improvement in SDM ( ɳp2 = 0.02) and an effect ( ɳp2 = 0.10) on DES was found in the experimental group. Significantly more PtDA-users (51\% vs. 29\%, φ = 0.22) chose less intensive aftercare, leading to a small reduction of hospital costs (122 vs. 92 Euro, ɳp2 = 0.01), and a large increase in average consultation time (12.5 min; ɳp2 = 0.29).
Conclusion
This pilot study showed promising effects of the PtDA on SDM and hospital costs. The PtDA can be developed further to potentially reduce the increased consultation time.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.pec.2019.07.015},
	abstract = {Objective
To conduct an economic evaluation of a tailored e-learning program, which successfully improved practice nurses’ smoking cessation guideline adherence.
Methods
The economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial, in which 269 practice nurses recruited 388 smoking patients. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using guideline adherence as effect measure on practice nurse level, and continued smoking abstinence on patient level. Cost-utility was assessed on patient level, using patients’ Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as effect measure.
Results
The e-learning program was likely to be cost-effective on practice nurse level, as adherence to an additional guideline step cost €1,586. On patient level, cost-effectiveness was slightly likely after six months (cost per additional quitter: €7,126), but not after twelve months. The cost-utility analysis revealed slight cost-effectiveness (cost per QALY gained: €18,431) on patient level.
Conclusion
Providing practice nurses with a tailored e-learning program is cost-effective to improve their smoking cessation counseling. Though, cost-effectiveness on patient level was not found after twelve months, potentially resulting from smoking relapse.
Practice implications
Widespread implementation of the e-learning program can improve the quality of smoking cessation care in general practice. Strategies to prevent patients’ smoking relapse should be further explored to improve patients’ long-term abstinence.},

	abstract = {Journal of Medical Internet Research - International Scientific Journal for Medical Research, Information and Communication on the Internet, \#Preprint \#PeerReviewMe: Warning: This is a unreviewed preprint. Readers are warned that the document has not been peer-reviewed by expert/patient reviewers or an academic editor, may contain misleading claims, and is likely to undergo changes before final publication, if accepted, or may have been rejected/withdrawn. Readers with interest and expertise are encouraged to sign up as peer-reviewer, if the paper is within an open peer-review period. Please cite this preprint only for review purposes or for grant applications and CVs (if you are the author). Background: Decision aids (DAs) may be used to facilitate an autonomous, informed decision to cease smoking and promote the uptake of evidence-based cessation assistance (i.e. behavioral support, nicotine replacement therapy and/or prescription medication). However, knowledge is lacking regarding their effective elements and (cost-)effectiveness. Objective: A fully automated online DA (called ‘VISOR’) that includes both an implicit and explicit value-clarification exercise was developed that helps smokers to choose evidence-based cessation assistance. This DA will be tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: The development of the DA ’VISOR’ was based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) guidelines. Viewpoints of both end users (collected through 20 interviews with current smokers) and clinical \& scientific experts (assessed using a Delphi study with 24 scientists and 38 clinicians) were assessed regarding cessation tool decision making and preferred DA content. These findings, together with principles from the Self-Determination Theory, served as input for the development of the online DA. A first DA prototype was alpha tested in September 2019 and beta-tested (usability) in December 2019; feedback was incorporated and resulted in a final DA version. The DA combines intuitive and deliberate decision-making processes to facilitate both decision-making styles. An RCT will be conducted to assess the DA’s (cost-)-effectiveness. Within this RCT the DA will be compared to a DA that will not include the explicit value clarification exercise. Results: Data regarding the effect of the VISOR DA is currently being collected, expecting conclusion in 2021. Conclusions: By making use of an iterative process that integrated different stakeholders’ perspectives (including end users) we were able to systematically design an evidence-based DA. The effect of the DA on decision-making and smoking outcomes is currently being studied. Clinical Trial: The trial is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NL8270).},

The prevalence of chronic disease is considerable, and dietary behaviours influence the progression of many chronic diseases.

Objective
To describe GPs' perceived interest, confidence and barriers to support patients to have a healthy diet.
Method
A 24-item online and written survey was distributed in a national weekly newsletter to GPs in Australia. Results were descriptively analysed and investigated for associations with GPs' demographic characteristics.
Results
A total of 322 GPs responded to the survey. Nearly all (n = 295, 91.6\%) were interested in supporting patients to eat well, and most (n = 231, 71.7\%) reported moderately high confidence for providing nutrition care with clear public health messages for conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Many GPs (n = 170, 52.8\%) cited lack of time as the biggest barrier to providing nutrition care, and the overwhelming majority (n = 289, 89.8\%) were interested in receiving additional education and training to enhance their nutrition knowledge and skills.
Discussion
Many GPs are interested in nutrition and would benefit from educational programmes that improve their competence to provide nutrition care. Professional development opportunities should focus on the identification of nutritional risk and the promotion of healthy dietary behaviours within the time constraints of a standard consultation.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify the decision-making needs of women about the use of natural health products (NHP) at menopause and to develop a decision aid responsive to their needs. Design: A qualitative study using focus groups, key informant interviews and group consultation. Content analysis was guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. Methods: Six focus groups with menopausal women aged 45 to 64 (n = 40) and key informant interviews (n = 15; physicians, nurses, women' s advocacy group, NHP stores owners, pharmacists, policy makers) were conducted in two Canadian cities. Two groups of menopausal women (n = 11) were consulted to obtain feedback on the acceptability of the new patient decision aid. Results: The most common difficult decisions identified by women were: whether or not to take NHP; which NHP to choose; and whether or not to take anything for menopausal symptoms. In addition, key informants identified the challenge of choosing between hormone therapy and NHP for menopausal symptoms. The main sources of difficulty in making these decisions were the following: (1) inadequate knowledge and unrealistic expectations associated with NHP; (2) closed mindedness of physicians to discussion about NHP; (3) conflicting opinions of others; (4) inadequate resources to support NHP decision-making (e.g., information, finances, time); and (5) menopausal symptoms interfering with decision-making (e.g., lack of sleep due to hot flashes). To facilitate decision making, participants suggested the need for information about available choices, tighter regulation of NHP by the government, and access to health professionals conversant in NHP and medical options. The patient decision aid was developed according to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards and based on women' s identified needs. Women described the aid as easy to understand and useful for considering the decisions about NHP. Conclusions: Middle-age women reported difficulty when facing decisions about the use of NHP. Many sources of difficulty could be addressed in the patient decision aid. Subsequent studies should evaluate the effect of this decision aid on the decision-making process of women.},

	abstract = {Background: 
The relationship between satisfaction with information and decision regret has not been previously studied in breast reconstruction patients. The objective of this study, therefore, was to assess this relationship and the factors that may influence satisfaction with preoperative information, including self-efficacy (confidence with seeking medical knowledge).
Methods:
All patients who underwent breast reconstruction between January of 2009 and March of 2011 were approached to complete the Modified Stanford Self-Efficacy Scale (1 to 10), the satisfaction with information subscale of the BREAST-Q (1 to 100), and the Decision Regret Scale (1 to 100). Two multinomial logistic regression models were built to assess the relationship between patient-reported satisfaction with information and decision regret, and to evaluate the relationship among satisfaction with information, self-efficacy level, and sociodemographic characteristics.
Results:
In 100 participants (71 percent response rate), the mean Decision Regret Scale score was 9.3 ± 17.3 of 100, and the majority of patients experienced no regret (60 percent). We found that regret was significantly reduced when patients were more satisfied with the preoperative information that they received from their plastic surgeons (β = 0.95; 95 percent CI, 0.93 to 0.96). Furthermore, patients reported higher satisfaction with information when they possessed more self-efficacy irrespective of their sociodemographic characteristics (β = 1.06; 95 percent CI, 1.04 to 1.09).
Conclusions:
Patients who possess lower levels of self-efficacy are at greater risk for experiencing dissatisfaction with the information that they receive in the preoperative period, and ultimately suffered more regret over their decision to undergo breast reconstruction.

PtDAs are tools that can help encourage SDM by providing information about competing treatment options and elucidating patients׳ values and preferences. Implementing PtDAs into routine practice may incur additional costs through training or increases in physician time. Prominent commentaries have proposed that these costs might be offset if patients choose less expensive options than their providers. However, the cost-effectiveness of PtDAs to date is unclear. The aim of this study was to review the economic evidence from PtDA trials. Our search identified 5347 articles, with 29 included following full-text review. Only one economic evaluation of a PtDA has been completed, which found a PtDA to be cost-saving in women with menorrhagia. Other studies included in the review indicated that PtDAs will likely increase up-front costs, but in some contexts may reduce short-term costs by reducing the uptake of invasive treatments, such as elective surgery. Few studies comprehensively captured long-term costs or measured benefits in a manner conducive to economic evaluation (QALYs or general health utilities). Our review suggests that policy makers currently have insufficient economic evidence to appropriately consider their investments in PtDAs.},

Participants General practices Inclusion criteria: \&gt;4 medical partners; list size \&gt;7000; and a diabetes register with \&gt;1\% of practice population. 191 practices assessed for eligibility, and 49 practices randomised and completed the study. Patients People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) taking at least two oral glucose-lowering drugs with maximum tolerated dose with a glycosolated haemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than 7.4\% (IFCC HbA1c \&gt;57 mmol/mol) or advised in the preceeding 6 months to add or consider changing to insulin therapy. Exclusion criteria: currently using insulin therapy; difficulty reading or understanding English; difficulty in understanding the purpose of the study; visual or cognitive impairment or mentally ill. A total of 182 assessed for eligibility, 175 randomised to 95 intervention and 80 controls, and 167 completion and analysis. Intervention Brief training of clinicians and use of PDA with patients in single consultation. Primary outcomes Decision quality (Decisional Conflict Scores, knowledge, realistic expectations and autonomy) and glycaemic control (glycosolated haemoglobin, HbA1c). Secondary outcomes Knowledge and realistic expectations of the risks and benefits of insulin therapy and diabetic complications. Results Intervention group: lower total Decisional Conflict Scores (17.4 vs 25.2, p\&lt;0.001); better knowledge (51.6\% vs 28.8\%, p\&lt;0.001); realistic expectations (risk of ‘hypo’, ‘weight gain’, ‘complications’; 81.0\% vs 5.2\%, 70.5\% vs 5.3\%, 26.3\% vs 5.0\% respectively, p\&lt;0.001); and were more autonomous in decision-making (64.1\% vs 42.9\%, p=0.012). No significant difference in the glycaemic control between the two groups. Conclusions Use of the PANDAs decision aid reduces decisional conflict, improves knowledge, promotes realistic expectations and autonomy in people with diabetes making treatment choices in general practice.

	abstract = {Researchers often conduct mediation analysis in order to indirectly assess the effect of a proposed cause on some outcome through a proposed mediator. The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Distributing a multiple computer-tailored smoking cessation intervention through the Internet has several advantages for both provider and receiver. Most important, a large audience of smokers can be reached while a highly individualized and personal form of feedback can be maintained. However, such a smoking cessation program has yet to be developed and implemented in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a Web-based multiple computer-tailored smoking cessation program on smoking cessation outcomes in a sample of Dutch adult smokers. METHODS: Smokers were recruited from December 2009 to June 2010 by advertising our study in the mass media and on the Internet. Those interested and motivated to quit smoking within 6 months (N = 1123) were randomly assigned to either the experimental (n = 552) or control group (n = 571). Respondents in the experimental group received the fully automated Web-based smoking cessation program, while respondents in the control group received no intervention. After 6 weeks and after 6 months, we assessed the effect of the intervention on self-reported 24-hour point prevalence abstinence, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, and prolonged abstinence using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 1123 respondents, 449 (40.0\%) completed the 6-week follow-up questionnaire and 291 (25.9\%) completed the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. We used a negative scenario to replace missing values. That is, we considered respondents lost to follow-up to still be smoking. The computer-tailored program appeared to have significantly increased 24-hour point prevalence abstinence (odds ratio [OR] 1.85, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–2.65), 7-day point prevalence abstinence (OR 2.17, 95\% CI 1.44–3.27), and prolonged abstinence (OR 1.99, 95\% CI 1.28–3.09) rates reported after 6 weeks. After 6 months, however, no intervention effects could be identified. Results from complete-case analyses were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented suggest that the Web-based computer-tailored smoking cessation program had a significant effect on abstinence reported after a 6-week period. At the 6-month follow-up, however, no intervention effects could be identified. This might be explained by the replacement of missing values on the primary outcome measures due to attrition using a negative scenario. While results were similar when using a less conservative scenario (ie, complete-case analyses), the results should still be interpreted with caution. Further research should aim at identifying strategies that will prevent high attrition in the first place and, subsequently, to identify the best strategies for dealing with missing data when studies have high attrition rates.

The results of a first study (N=629) using items from a comprehensive decision style measure (the Decision Styles Questionnaire), support the two-component model. The results of a second study (N=305), based on an alternative set of style measures, provide support for an extended version of the model.

Values clarification (VC) techniques are part of decision aids that help patients assimilate the information with their personal values. There is little evidence that these techniques contribute to enhanced decision making over and above the provision of good quality information. Objectives? To assess whether VC techniques are active ingredients in enhancing informed decision making and explain how and why they work. Methods? Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (i) information only, (ii) information plus implicit task, (iii) information plus explicit task. Thirty healthy women from a UK University participated by making a hypothetical choice between taking part in a clinical trial and having the standard treatment for breast cancer. Verbal protocols were elicited by think-aloud method and content analysed to assess informed decision making; a questionnaire was completed after the decision assessing decision preference, perceptions of decisional conflict and ambivalence. Data were analysed using multivariate statistics. Findings? No participants changed their decision preference as a result of the VC techniques. Women in the explicit VC group evaluated more information in accord with personal values, expressed lower ambivalence, decisional uncertainty and greater clarity of personal values than those in the implicit VC and control groups. Feelings of ambivalence about both options were related to decisional conflict. Conclusion? Explicit VC techniques are likely to be active ingredients in decision aids. They work by enabling people to deliberate about the decision information in accord with their personal values, which is associated with a better decision experience.},

The robustness of this theory derives from the many disciplines and fields of study in which diffusion has been studied, from the international richness of these studies, and from the variety of new ideas, practices, programs, and technologies that have been the objects of diffusion research. Early theorizing from the beginning of the 20th century was gradually displaced by post hoc empirical research that described and explained diffusion processes. By the 1950s, diffusion researchers had begun to apply the collective knowledge learned about naturalistic diffusion in tests of process interventions to affect the spread of innovations. Now, this purposive objective has given form to a science of dissemination in which evidence-based practices are designed a priori not just to result in internal validity but to increase the likelihood that external validity and diffusion both are more likely to result. Here, I review diffusion theory and focus on seven concepts—intervention attributes, intervention clusters, demonstration projects, societal sectors, reinforcing contextual conditions, opinion leadership, and intervention adaptation—with potential for accelerating the spread of evidence-based practices, programs, and policies in the field of social work.},

The dropout rates among the treatment conditions are significantly different.Conclusions.The findings of this study demonstrate that attritions in longitudinal smoking prevention studies are not at random.

	abstract = {An online decision aid to support persons having a genetic predisposition to cancer and their partners during reproductive decision-making was developed. A two-phase usability test was conducted among 12 couples (N = 22; 2 persons participated without their partner) at risk for hereditary cancer and 15 health care providers. Couples and health care providers expressed similar suggestions for improvements, and evaluated the modified decision aid as acceptable, easy to use, and comprehensible. The final decision aid was pilot tested (N = 16) with paired sample t tests comparing main outcomes (decisional conflict, knowledge, realistic expectations regarding the reproductive options and decision self-efficacy) before (T0), immediately (T1) and 2 weeks after (T2) use of the decision aid. Pilot testing indicated decreased decisional conflict scores, increased knowledge, and improved realistic expectations regarding the reproductive options, at T1 and T2. No effect was found for couples’ decision self-efficacy. The positive findings during usability testing were thus reflected in the pilot study. The decision aid will be further evaluated in a nationwide pretest–posttest study to facilitate implementation in the onco-genetic counselling setting.

	abstract = {Objectives Unresolved clinically significant decisional conflict (CSDC) in patients following a consultation with health professionals is often the result of inadequate patient involvement in decision-making and may result in poor outcomes. We sought to identify the prevalence of CSDC in studies on decision-making in primary care and to explore its risk factors.Setting We performed a secondary analysis of existing data sets from studies conducted in Primary Care Practice-Based Research Networks in Québec and Ontario, Canada.Participants Eligible studies included a patient-reported measure on the 16-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) following a decision made with a healthcare professional with no study design restriction.Primary and secondary outcome measures CSDC was defined as a score ≥25/100 on the DCS. The prevalence of CSDC was stratified by sex; and patient-level logistic regression analysis was performed to explore its potential risk factors. Data sets of studies were analysed individually and qualitatively compared.Results 5 projects conducted between 2003 and 2010 were included. They covered a range of decisions: prenatal genetic screening, antibiotics for acute respiratory infections and miscellaneous. Altogether, the 5 projects gathered data from encounters with a total of 1338 primary care patients (69\% female; range of age 15–83). The prevalence of CSDC in patients varied across studies and ranged from 10.3\% (95\% CI 7.2\% to 13.4\%) to 31.1\% (95\% CI 26.6\% to 35.6\%). Across the 5 studies, risk factors of CSDC included being male, living alone and being 45 or older.Conclusions Prevalence of CSDC in patients who had enrolled in studies conducted in primary care contexts was substantial and appeared to vary according to the type of decision as well as to patient characteristics such as sex, living arrangement and age. Patients presenting risk factors of CSDC should be offered tools to increase their involvement in decision-making.},

Setting and participants? A total of 1014 were recruited from a convenience sample of 3391 smokers who intended to quit smoking within 6?months. Design and intervention? Smokers were assigned randomly to either receive the decision aid or no intervention. The decision aid was expected to motivate quitters to use efficacious cessation methods and contained neutral information on treatment methods, distinguishing between efficacious and non-efficacious treatments. Measurements? Baseline questionnaire and follow-ups were used 2?weeks and 6?months after the start of the intervention.? Findings? The decision aid increased knowledge of cessation methods and induced a more positive attitude towards these methods. Furthermore, 45\% reported increased confidence about being able to quit and 43\% said it helped them to choose between treatments. However, no clear effect on usage of treatment aids was found, but the intervention group had more quit attempts (OR?=?1.52, 95\% CI 1.14?2.02) and higher point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up (20.2\% versus 13.6\%; OR?=?1.51, 95\% CI?=?1.07?2.11). Conclusions? An aid to help smokers decide to use efficacious treatment when attempting to quit smoking had a positive effect on smoking cessation, while failing to increase the usage of efficacious treatment. This finding lends support to the notion that the mere promotion of efficacious treatments for tobacco addiction might increase the number of quit attempts, irrespective of the actual usage of treatment.},

Methods: The data come from the 1996 California Tobacco Survey, a random sample of 4480 individuals (18 years or older) who tried to quit smoking in the 12 months before the survey. We calculated population estimates for demographics, smoking histories, rate of using assistance, and abstinence rates. Results: One fifth (19.9\%) of those who attempted to quit smoking used one or more forms of assistance: self-help, counseling, and/or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Heavy smokers were more likely to use assistance than were light smokers. Women were more likely to use assistance than were men, and usage increased with age. Whites were more likely to use NRT than were other ethnic groups. Overall, those who used assistance had a higher success rate than those who did not; the 12-month abstinence rates were 15.2\% and 7.0\%, respectively. Conclusions: Use of assistance for smoking cessation has increased over recent years, from 7.9\% in 1986 to 19.9\% in 1996. The use of assistance is associated with a greater success rate. Anti-tobacco campaigns in California and increased availability of multiple forms of assistance probably facilitated the use of assistance and successful quitting for those using assistance.},

The theory is also increasingly being used as a framework for conducting behavior change interventions. In this meta-analysis, we identified 82 papers reporting results of 123 interventions in a variety of disciplines. Our analysis confirmed the effectiveness of TPB-based interventions, with a mean effect size of .50 for changes in behavior and effect sizes ranging from .14 to .68 for changes in antecedent variables (behavioral, normative, and control beliefs, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention). Further analyses revealed that the interventions’ effectiveness varied for the diverse behavior change methods. In addition, interventions conducted in public and with groups were more successful than interventions in private locations or focusing on individuals. Finally, we identified gender and education as well as behavioral domain as moderators of the interventions’ effectiveness.},

Results 212 nominated people were invited to participate. Of those invited, 122 participated in the first round (77 researchers, 21 patients, 10 practitioners, 14 policy makers); 104/122 (85\%) participated in the second round. 74 of 83 criteria were retained in the following domains: systematic development process (9/9 criteria); providing information about options (13/13); presenting probabilities (11/13); clarifying and expressing values (3/3); using patient stories (2/5); guiding/coaching (3/5); disclosing conflicts of interest (5/5); providing internet access (6/6); balanced presentation of options (3/3); using plain language (4/6); basing information on up to date evidence (7/7); and establishing effectiveness (8/8). Conclusions Criteria were given the highest ratings where evidence existed, and these were retained. Gaps in research were highlighted.

METHODS: Conceptual review of the strengths and weaknesses of intuitive and analytical decision making and applying these findings to the practice of DA design. RESULTS: DAs combine several important goals: providing information, helping to clarify treatment related values, supporting preference construction processes, and facilitating more active engagement in decision making. Many DAs encourage patients to approach a decision analytically, without solid theoretical or empirical grounding for this approach. Existing research in other domains suggests that both intuition and deliberation may support decision making. We discuss implications for patient decision support and challenge researchers to determine when combining these processes leads to better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Intuitive and analytical decision processes may have complementary effects in achieving the desired outcomes of patient decision support. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: DA developers should be aware that tools solely targeted at supporting deliberation may limit DA effectiveness and harm preference construction processes. Patients may be better served by combined strategies that draw on the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of both deliberative and intuitive processes.},

	abstract = {Context The scarcity of data addressing the health effects of popular diets is an important public health concern, especially since patients and physicians are interested in using popular diets as individualized eating strategies for disease prevention.Objective To assess adherence rates and the effectiveness of 4 popular diets (Atkins, Zone, Weight Watchers, and Ornish) for weight loss and cardiac risk factor reduction.Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center randomized trial at an academic medical center in Boston, Mass, of overweight or obese (body mass index: mean, 35; range, 27-42) adults aged 22 to 72 years with known hypertension, dyslipidemia, or fasting hyperglycemia. Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.Intervention A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.Main Outcome Measures One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.Results Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53\%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65\%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65\%] of 40 completed, P \&lt; .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50\%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10\% (all P\&lt;.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P\&lt;.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).Conclusions Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: While smoking remains one of the leading causes of death in Mexico, uptake of evidence-based cessation therapy remains low. Widespread use of mobile devices and internet in Mexico has created new avenues for providing access to cessation treatment. METHODS: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of "Vive Sin Tabaco... inverted exclamation markDecidete!" (English: Live without Tobacco.... Decide!), a web-based, informed decision-making tool designed to help Mexican smokers develop a quit plan and take advantage of cessation resources. We invited 164 smokers in two primary care clinics. Measures included physical, situational, and psychological nicotine dependence, interest in using pharmacotherapy and counseling, smoking status at 3 months, and satisfaction with the program. RESULTS: Most participants were light smokers and reported low-to-moderate nicotine dependence. Immediately after using inverted exclamation markVive Sin Tabaco... inverted exclamation markDecidete!, the majority were interested in quitting, set a quit date, and reported interest in using pharmacotherapy and cessation counseling. Follow-up rate at 3 months was 81.5\%; seven-day point prevalence abstinence was 19.1\% using intention-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSION: Integration of e-Health tools in primary healthcare settings has the potential to improve knowledge about cessation treatments among smokers and integrate smoking cessation into routine of care.},

	abstract = {Decision aids, sometimes known as decision-support tools, are increasingly used to help patients to understand treatment options and to reach an informed decision consistent with their own values, yet methods for their economic evaluation have received limited attention. This is at odds with the increasingly rigorous methods being applied to assess the cost effectiveness of other health technologies. This paper reviews current approaches to evaluating decision aids and proposes a new method for assessing their benefits relative to other interventions in a resource-constrained health system that seeks to improve health, equity and patient satisfaction. Current evaluation frameworks are found to be unsuitable for the economic evaluation of decision aids since their objectives are broader than health maximisation. Decision aids may generate significant non-health benefits such as improved patient knowledge and satisfaction, which cannot be assessed using cost-utility analysis. A stated-preference consultation time trade-off (CTTO) is proposed in which a proportion of hypothetical physician consultation is traded for use of the decision aid. A decision aid provides information for a patient to make an informed choice and therefore may be considered to be a substitute for physician time. The CTTO can be reported in consultation minutes or converted to monetary units using the cost of physician time. These values may be used, alongside the implementation cost, for economic evaluation.},

The results from this randomised controlled trial comparing routine with decision-aided consultations in the prenatal diagnosis for Down’s syndrome context are used to describe the strategies employed during decision making, to assess the impact of a decision aid on decision processes, and to investigate decision process and outcome associations. Data were elicited from two content analyses of consultation transcripts and questionnaires assessing knowledge, anxiety, decisional conflict, reasons, and information usefulness. 68/106 women completed measures at consultation and follow-up. Decision-aided women employed more cognitive and emotional strategies during decision making. More negative evaluations during decision making were associated with better outcomes. Decision-aided consultations facilitated the employment of strategies associated with more effective choices. These consultations take longer and elicit greater expressions of negative affect, so may be less rewarding encounters for health professionals.},

Despite the growing evidence in physical health and adult mental health, however, little information is available about how mobile phones are implemented to deliver mental health services to the younger population. The purpose of this scoping study was to map the current state of knowledge regarding mobile mental health (mMental Health) for young people (age 13-24 years), identify gaps, and consider implications for future research. Seventeen articles that met the inclusion criteria provided evidence for mobile phones as a way to engage youth in therapeutic activities. The flexibility, interactivity, and spontaneous nature of mobile communications were also considered advantageous in encouraging persistent and continual access to care outside clinical settings. Four gaps in current knowledge were identified: the scarcity of studies conducted in low and middle income countries, the absence of information about the real-life feasibility of mobile tools, the need to address the issue of technical and health literacy of both young users and health professionals, and the need for critical discussion regarding diverse ethical issues associated with mobile phone use. We suggest that mMental Health researchers and clinicians should carefully consider the ethical issues related to patient-practitioner relationship, best practices, and the logic of self-surveillance.},

	abstract = {Background  Low-carbohydrate diets have become increasingly popular for weight loss. However, evidence from individual trials about benefits and risks of these diets to achieve weight loss and modify cardiovascular risk factors is preliminary.Methods  We used the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy to identify trials comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate diets without restriction of energy intake vs low-fat diets in individuals with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of at least 25. Included trials had to report changes in body weight in intention-to-treat analysis and to have a follow-up of at least 6 months. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality of randomized controlled trials.Results  Five trials including a total of 447 individuals fulfilled our inclusion criteria. After 6 months, individuals assigned to low-carbohydrate diets had lost more weight than individuals randomized to low-fat diets (weighted mean difference, –3.3 kg; 95\% confidence interval [CI], −5.3 to −1.4 kg). This difference was no longer obvious after 12 months (weighted mean difference, −1.0 kg; 95\% CI, −3.5 to 1.5 kg). There were no differences in blood pressure. Triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-carbohydrate diets (after 6 months, for triglycerides, weighted mean difference, −22.1 mg/dL [−0.25 mmol/L]; 95\% CI, −38.1 to −5.3 mg/dL [−0.43 to −0.06 mmol/L]; and for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, weighted mean difference, 4.6 mg/dL [0.12 mmol/L]; 95\% CI, 1.5-8.1 mg/dL [0.04-0.21 mmol/L]), but total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-fat diets (weighted mean difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 6 months, 5.4 mg/dL [0.14 mmol/L]; 95\% CI, 1.2-10.1 mg/dL [0.03-0.26 mmol/L]).Conclusions  Low-carbohydrate, non–energy-restricted diets appear to be at least as effective as low-fat, energy-restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. However, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values when low-carbohydrate diets to induce weight loss are considered.},

	abstract = {Summary The aim of this study is to identify patterns of sleep difficulty in older women, to investigate whether sleep difficulty is an indicator for poorer survival, and to determine whether sleep difficulty modifies the association between disease and death. Data were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, a 15‐year longitudinal cohort study, with 10 721 women aged 70–75 years at baseline. Repeated‐measures latent class analysis identified four classes of persistent sleep difficulty: troubled sleepers (N = 2429, 22.7\%); early wakers (N = 3083, 28.8\%); trouble falling asleep (N = 1767, 16.5\%); and untroubled sleepers (N = 3442, 32.1\%). Sleep difficulty was an indicator for mortality. Compared with untroubled sleepers, hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for troubled sleepers, early wakers, and troubled falling asleep were 1.12 (1.03, 1.23), 0.81 (0.75, 0.91) and 0.89 (0.79, 1.00), respectively. Sleep difficulty may modify the prognosis of women with chronic diseases. Hazard ratios (and 95\% confidence intervals) for having three or more diseases (compared with 0 diseases) were enhanced for untroubled sleepers, early wakers and trouble falling asleep [hazard ratio = 1.86 (1.55, 2.22), 1.91 (1.56, 2.35) and 1.98 (1.47, 2.66), respectively], and reduced for troubled sleepers [hazard ratio = 1.57 (1.24, 1.98)]. Sleep difficulty in older women is more complex than the presence or absence of sleep difficulty, and should be considered when assessing the risk of death associated with disease.},

Treatment strategies may be guided by what sleep durations predict optimal survival and whether insomnia might signal mortality risks.Methods  In 1982, the Cancer Prevention Study II of the American Cancer Society asked participants about their sleep duration and frequency of insomnia. Cox proportional hazards survival models were computed to determine whether sleep duration or frequency of insomnia was associated with excess mortality up to 1988, controlling simultaneously for demographics, habits, health factors, and use of various medications.Results  Participants were more than 1.1 million men and women from 30 to 102 years of age. The best survival was found among those who slept 7 hours per night. Participants who reported sleeping 8 hours or more experienced significantly increased mortality hazard, as did those who slept 6 hours or less. The increased risk exceeded 15\% for those reporting more than 8.5 hours sleep or less than3.5 or 4.5 hours. In contrast, reports of "insomnia" were not associated with excess mortality hazard. As previously described, prescription sleeping pill use was associated with significantly increased mortality after control for reported sleep durations and insomnia.Conclusions  Patients can be reassured that short sleep and insomnia seem associated with little risk distinct from comorbidities. Slight risks associated with8 or more hours of sleep and sleeping pill use need further study. Causality is unproven.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objective: To demonstrate that human overeating is not just a passive response to salient environmental triggers and powerful physiological drives; it is also about making choices. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been strongly implicated in the neural circuitry necessary for making advantageous decisions when various options for action are available. Decision?making deficits have been found in patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions and in those with substance dependence?impairments that reflect an inability to advantageously assess future consequences. That is, they choose immediate rewards in the face of future long?term negative consequences. Research Methods and Procedures: We extended this research to the study of overeating and overweight, testing a regression model that predicted that poor decision making (as assessed by a validated computerized gambling task) and a tendency to overeat under stress would correlate with higher BMI in a group of healthy adult women (N = 41) representing a broad range of body weights. Results: We found statistically significant main effects for both independent variables in the predicted direction (p {\textless} 0.05; R2 = 0.35). Indeed, the decision?making impairments across the 100 trials of the computer task were greater in those with high BMI than in previous studies with drug addicts. Discussion: Findings suggested that cortical and subcortical processes, which regulate one's ability to inhibit short?term rewards when the long?term consequences are deleterious, may also influence eating behaviors in a culture dominated by so many, and such varied, sources of palatable and calorically dense sources of energy.},

Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.Intervention A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.Main Outcome Measures One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.Results Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53\%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65\%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65\%] of 40 completed, P \&lt; .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50\%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10\% (all P\&lt;.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P\&lt;.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).Conclusions Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid development of effective treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, insomnia management remains suboptimal at the practice interface. Patient preferences play a critical role in influencing treatment outcomes. However, there is currently a mismatch between patient preferences and clinician recommendations, partly perpetuated by a limited understanding of the patients' decision-making process. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to empirically quantify patient preferences for treatment attributes common to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological insomnia treatments. METHOD: An efficient dual-response discrete choice experiment was conducted to evaluate patient treatment preferences for managing insomnia. The sample included 205 patients with self-reported insomnia and an Insomnia Severity Index {\textgreater}/= 14. Participants were presented with two unlabelled hypothetical scenarios with an opt-out option across 12 choice sets. Data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model to investigate the influence of five attributes (i.e. time, onset of action, maintainability of improved sleep, length of treatment, and monthly cost) on treatment preferences. RESULTS: Treatments were preferentially viewed if they conferred long-term sleep benefits (p {\textless} 0.05); had an ongoing, as opposed to a predefined, duration of treatment course (p {\textless} 0.05); required some, as opposed to no, additional time commitment (p {\textless} 0.05); and had lower monthly out-of-pocket treatment costs (p {\textless} 0.001). However, treatment onset of action had no influence on preference. Age, help-seeking status, concession card status and fatigue severity significantly influenced treatment preference. CONCLUSION: Participants' prioritization of investing time in treatment and valuing the maintainability of therapeutic gains suggests a stronger inclination towards non-pharmacological treatment, defying current assumptions that patients prefer 'quick-fixes' for managing insomnia.},

Enhanced decision-making after bariatric surgery may strengthen patients' ability to delay gratification, helping to establish appropriate eating behavior. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare a preoperative group with a postoperative group with regard to daily PA, decision-making, and eating disturbances; and (2) investigate the relationship between these variables. METHODS: The study included 71 bariatric surgery candidates (78 \% women, BMI [kg/m(2)] M = 46.9, SD = 6.0) and 73 postoperative patients (78 \% women, BMI M = 32.0, SD = 4.1; 89 \% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 11 \% sleeve gastrectomy; months postoperative M = 8.2, SD = 3.5; total weight loss [\%] M = 33.2, SD = 8.9) who completed SenseWear Pro2 activity monitoring. Decision-making was assessed using a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task and eating disorder psychopathology using the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. RESULTS: The number of patients who were classified as physically inactive was similarly high in the pre- and postoperative groups. No group differences emerged with regard to decision-making, but the postoperative group exhibited less eating disturbances than the preoperative group. No significant associations were found between PA, decision-making, and eating behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Patients after bariatric surgery were not more physically active than bariatric surgery candidates, which should be considered in care programs. Additionally, future research is needed to explore the possible link between PA, patients' decision-making abilities, and eating disturbances concerning dose-response questions.},

This study explored the feasibility of using Facebook to recruit parents of middle school students to a self-directed family program to prevent adolescent drug use. The study used paid Facebook ads aiming to recruit 100 parents in Washington and Colorado using marijuana- or parenting-focused messages. All ad-recruited parents were also invited to refer others in order to compare Facebook recruitment to web-based respondent-driven sampling. Despite offering a \$15 incentive for each successfully referred participant, the majority of the screened (70.4\%) and eligible (65.1\%) parents were recruited through Facebook ads. Yet, eligibility and consent rates were significantly higher among referred (76.6 and 57.3\%, respectively) than Facebook-recruited parents (60.0 and 36.6\%, respectively). Click-through rates on Facebook were higher for marijuana-focused than parenting-focused ads (0.72 and 0.65\%, respectively). The final sample (54\% Facebook-recruited) consisted of 103 demographically homogeneous parents (female, educated, non-Hispanic White, and mostly from Washington). Although Facebook was an effective and efficient method to recruit parents to a study with equal to better cost-effectiveness than traditional recruitment strategies, the promise of social media to reach a diverse population was not realized. Additional approaches to Facebook recruitment are needed to reach diverse samples in real-world settings and increase public health impact of family programs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young men can be difficult to engage in health research using traditional methods of recruitment. Social networking sites are increasingly being used to recruit participants into health research, due to their cost effectiveness, overall generalizability, and wide reach. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using Facebook to recruit young Australian men into a human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence study. METHODS: We recruited male permanent residents of Australia, aged 18 to 35 years, into the HPV in Young Males (HYM) study through targeted advertising placed on Facebook. Consenting participants completed an online questionnaire and provided a self-collected penile swab for HPV DNA detection and genotyping. We compared sociodemographic characteristics of the study population with those of the general Australian male population, based on Australian 2011 census data. RESULTS: Between February 2015 and February 2017, targeted Facebook advertisements reached 1,523,239 men, resulting in 41,811 clicks through to the study website, with 1072 (2.56\%) converting to lodgment of an expression of interest. Of these, 681 (63.53\%) provided written informed consent and 535 (78.6\% of recruited participants) completed all the study requirements. Reasons for participating in the study included altruism, past history of HPV, gaining more knowledge about HPV or the vaccine, working in the health industry, and the monetary compensation. The average advertising cost per completed study participant was Aus \$48. Compared with the census population, HYM study participants were more likely to be Australian born (P{\textless}.001), be from Victoria (P=.003) or the Australian Capital Territory (P=.004), reside in a major city (P{\textless}.001), and have completed undergraduate (P{\textless}.001) or postgraduate education (P{\textless}.001). HYM study participants were less likely to report being a current smoker (P=.03), but were more likely to identify as bisexual or homosexual (294/529, 55.6\%, P{\textless}.001), than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Using Facebook is a feasible and efficient strategy for the recruitment of men from across Australia for HPV testing. This method could be used for monitoring the impact of HPV vaccination. Additional targeting may achieve a sample that is broadly demographically representative of the Australian population. Future research should explore how the sexual risk behavior characteristics of populations recruited through Facebook compare with those of traditional recruitment methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successful recruitment of participants to mobile health (mHealth) studies presents unique challenges over in-person studies. It is important to identify recruitment strategies that maximize the limited recruitment resources available to researchers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe a case study of a unique recruitment process used in a recent mHealth software app designed to increase smoking cessation among weight-concerned women smokers. The See Me Smoke-Free app was deployed to the Google Play Store (Alphabet, Inc., Google, LLC), where potential participants could download the app and enroll in the study. Users were invited in-app to participate in the study, with no in-person contact. The recruitment activities relied primarily on earned (free) and social media. METHODS: To determine the relationship between recruitment activities and participant enrollment, the researchers explored trends in earned and social media activity in relation to app installations, examined social media messaging in relation to reach or impressions, and described app users' self-reported referral source. The researchers collected and descriptively analyzed data regarding recruitment activities, social media audience, and app use during the 18-week recruitment period (March 30, 2015-July 31, 2015). Data were collected and aggregated from internal staff activity tracking documents and from Web-based data analytics software such as SumAll, Facebook Insights (Facebook, Inc.), and Google Analytics (Alphabet, Inc., Google, LLC). RESULTS: Media coverage was documented across 75 publications and radio or television broadcasts, 35 of which were local, 39 national, and 1 international. The research team made 30 Facebook posts and 49 tweets, yielding 1821 reaches and 6336 impressions, respectively. From March 30, 2015 to July 31, 2015, 289 unique users downloaded the app, and 151 participants enrolled in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Research identifying effective online recruitment methods for mHealth studies remains minimal, and findings are inconsistent. We demonstrated how earned media can be leveraged to recruit women to an mHealth smoking cessation trial at low cost. Using earned media and leveraging social media allowed us to enroll 3 times the number of participants that we anticipated enrolling. The cost of earned media resides in the staff time required to manage it, particularly the regular interaction with social media. We recommend communication and cooperation with university public affairs and social media offices, as well as affiliate programs in journalism and communications, so that earned media can be used as a recruitment strategy for mHealth behavior change interventions. However, press releases are not always picked up by the media and should not be considered as a stand-alone method of recruitment. Careful consideration of an intervention's broad appeal and how that translates into potential media interest is needed when including earned media as part of a comprehensive recruitment plan for mHealth research.},

Despite the growing evidence in physical health and adult mental health, however, little information is available about how mobile phones are implemented to deliver mental health services to the younger population. The purpose of this scoping study was to map the current state of knowledge regarding mobile mental health (mMental Health) for young people (age 13-24 years), identify gaps, and consider implications for future research. Seventeen articles that met the inclusion criteria provided evidence for mobile phones as a way to engage youth in therapeutic activities. The flexibility, interactivity, and spontaneous nature of mobile communications were also considered advantageous in encouraging persistent and continual access to care outside clinical settings. Four gaps in current knowledge were identified: the scarcity of studies conducted in low and middle income countries, the absence of information about the real-life feasibility of mobile tools, the need to address the issue of technical and health literacy of both young users and health professionals, and the need for critical discussion regarding diverse ethical issues associated with mobile phone use. We suggest that mMental Health researchers and clinicians should carefully consider the ethical issues related to patient-practitioner relationship, best practices, and the logic of self-surveillance.},

In the current study, we extended this research to examine whether a persuasive appeal’s effectiveness can be increased by aligning the message framing with the recipient’s personality profile. For a single product, we constructed five advertisements, each designed to target one of the five major trait domains of human personality. In a sample of 324 survey respondents, advertisements were evaluated more positively the more they cohered with participants’ dispositional motives. These results suggest that adapting persuasive messages to the personality traits of the target audience can be an effective way of increasing the messages’ impact, and highlight the potential value of personality-based communication strategies.},

Childcare illness absenteeism due to fever is mostly driven by fear towards fever in childcare staff and parents. This may cause high childcare absenteeism, healthcare service use, and work absenteeism in parents. This study evaluates a multicomponent intervention targeting determinants of decision-making among childcare staff on illness absenteeism due to fever and common infections.The multicomponent intervention was developed based on the Intervention Mapping approach and consisted of (i) an educational session, (ii) a decision tool, (iii) an information booklet and (iv) an online video. The intervention was evaluated in a cluster randomized controlled trial in Southern Netherlands. Nine centres received the intervention and nine provided childcare-as-usual. Primary outcome measure was the percentage of illness absenteeism on cluster level, defined as number of childcare days absent due to illness on total of registered childcare contract days in a 12-week period. Secondary outcome measures included intended behaviour, attitude, risk perception, knowledge and self-efficacy of childcare staff. Outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models accounting for clustering. Knowledge was descriptively analysed.Overall illness absenteeism was comparable in intervention (2.95\%) and control group (2.52\%). Secondary outcomes showed significant improvements in intervention group regarding intended behaviour, two of three attitude dimensions. Knowledge increased compared with control but no differences regarding self-efficacy.The intervention was not effective in reducing illness absenteeism. However, the intervention improved determinants of decision-making such as intended behaviour, attitude, and knowledge on fever.NTR6402 (registered on 21 April 2017).},

	abstract = {The current study quantified the degree to which group data are able to describe individual participants. We utilized intensive repeated-measures data—data that have been collected many times, across many individuals—to compare the distributions of bivariate correlations calculated within subjects vs. those calculated between subjects. Because the vast majority of social and medical science research aggregates across subjects, we aimed to assess how closely such aggregations reflect their constituent individuals. We provide evidence that conclusions drawn from aggregated data may be worryingly imprecise. Specifically, the variance in individuals is up to four times larger than in groups. These data call for a focus on idiography and open science that may substantially alter best-practice guidelines in the medical and behavioral sciences.Only for ergodic processes will inferences based on group-level data generalize to individual experience or behavior. Because human social and psychological processes typically have an individually variable and time-varying nature, they are unlikely to be ergodic. In this paper, six studies with a repeated-measure design were used for symmetric comparisons of interindividual and intraindividual variation. Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87–94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains. Researchers should explicitly test for equivalence of processes at the individual and group level across the social and medical sciences.},

	abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unor ginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original.

Risk factors in men include athletics, sexuality, psychiatric co-morbidity and negative life experiences. Differences in eating disorders exist between men and women relating to behavior and psychological symptoms. Men are much more likely than women to underestimate body size and desire a more muscular body. Men are less likely than women to engage in typical compensatory behaviors such as vomiting and more likely to engage in activities such as excessive exercise to attempt to lose weight or counteract the effects of eating. Men are more likely than women to binge rather than restrict due to negative body image. Studies show that men with eating disorders are less likely to seek treatment than women are. Obstacles to treatment include cultural biases toward eating disorders because they are considered to be female disorders, a lack of trained professionals and a lack of treatment setting that specifically deals with male eating disorders patients. Finally, even with little research to guide treatment of eating disorders, the outcome seems to be similar for men and women.},

A sample of young adults (N = 147) completed an online survey which measured SNS usage, problematic SNS use, BI, SE, and ED symptom/concerns. The findings revealed that females and males spent 4.1 ± 3.9 and 2.9 ± 2.8 hr on SNS, respectively, with the majority of time spent lurking (i.e., looking at another users’ profile but not actually communicating with them). Furthermore, problematic SNS use was found to be related to BI, SE, and ED symptoms/concerns. Moreover, SNS activities, such as lurking and posting comments on others’ profiles, were found to be related to BI, whereas SNS total time was found to be related to ED symptoms/concerns. Overall, this study demonstrates the possible correlational influence of SNSs on BI, SE, and ED symptoms/concerns.},

However, the effects that affiliation appeals (e.g., pictures depicting companionship during physical activities) and accompanying slogans have on motivating physical activity have been largely unexplored. Hence, our two studies experimentally tested the effects of exposure to affiliation-based pictures for overweight or less active people, as well as the moderating effect of affiliation motivation. The results of these two studies give some indication that group pictures (with or without an accompanying slogan) can be an effective strategy to improve high-risk populations? attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions to engage in physical activity. Affiliation motivation as a personality trait did not interact with these effects, but was positively associated with attitudes, independent of the group picture effect.},

	abstract = {Objective: The authors sought to expand on previous observations suggesting that body-image pathology is associated with illicit use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS). In particular, the authors compared current versus past AAS users and short-term versus long-term users in this respect. Method: The authors assessed 89 heterosexual men who lifted weights regularly–48 AAS users and 41 nonusers–on measures of self-esteem, attitudes toward male roles, body image, eating-related attitudes and behaviors, and muscle dysmorphia (“reverse anorexia nervosa”). Results: AAS users as a whole showed few differences from nonusers on most measures but showed greater symptoms of muscle dysmorphia (e.g., not allowing their bodies to be seen in public, giving up pleasurable activities because of body-appearance concerns). The current and past AAS users each differed only modestly from nonusers on most measures. Short-term AAS “experimenters” were also largely indistinguishable from nonusers, but the long-term AAS users showed striking and significant differences from nonusers on many measures, including marked symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and stronger endorsement of conventional male roles. Conclusions: Both body-image pathology and narrow stereotypic views of masculinity appear to be prominent among men with long-term AAS use. Although our cross-sectional observations cannot confirm that these factors help to cause or perpetuate AAS use, a causal hypothesis is certainly plausible and deserving of further testing in longitudinal studies. If these factors are indeed causal, then AAS users might respond to cognitive behavior approaches that simultaneously take aim at both types of maladaptive beliefs.},

An online survey (N = 305) was conducted among young Korean women (aged 18–29) in Korea. Results indicated that the frequency with which Korean female participants engaged in profile maintenance and social grooming activities on Facebook was positively associated with appearance comparison with peers, and the mediation analysis revealed that appearance comparison mediated the relationship between Facebook use variables and body image concerns, such as lower weight satisfaction and greater drive for thinness.

	abstract = {Bratman first proposed orthorexia nervosa in the late 1990s, defining it an obsession with eating healthy food to achieve, for instance, improved health. Today, in the Swedish media, excessive exercising plays a central role in relation to orthorexia. A few review articles on orthorexia have been conducted; however, these have not focused on aspects of food and eating, sport, exercise, or a societal perspective. The overall aim of this study was to provide an overview and synthesis of what philosophies of science approaches form the current academic framework of orthorexia. Key questions were: What aspects of food and eating are related to orthorexia? What role do exercise and sports play in relation to orthorexia? In what ways are orthorexia contextualized? Consequently, the concept of healthism was used to discuss and contextualize orthorexia. The method used was an integrative literature review; the material covered 19 empirical and theoretical articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This review demonstrates a multifaceted nature of orthorexia research; this field has been examined from four different philosophies of science approaches (i.e., empirical-atomistic, empirical-atomistic with elements of empirical-holistic, empirical-holistic, and rational-holistic) on individual, social, and societal levels. The majority of the articles followed an empirical-atomistic approach that focused on orthorexia as an individual issue, which was discussed using healthism. Our analysis indicates a need for (a) more empirical-holistic research that applies interpretive qualitative methods and uses a social perspective of health, e.g., healthism and (b) examining the role of sports and exercise in relation to orthorexia that takes the problematizing of ?orthorexic behaviours? within the sports context into account.},

	abstract = {Social media has been associated with body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms among young women and adolescent girls. However, despite notable evidence of susceptibility to body image pressures, it remains unknown whether these associations generalize to sexual minority men. A nationwide sample of 2,733 sexual minority men completed an online survey advertised to Australian and New Zealand users of a popular dating app. Participants answered questions about how frequently they used 11 different social media platforms in addition to questions about their dating app use, body image, eating disorder symptoms, and anabolic steroids. Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and Snapchat were the most frequently used social media platforms. A pattern of small-sized and positive associations emerged between social media use and body dissatisfaction, eating disorder symptoms, and thoughts about using anabolic steroids. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat evidenced the strongest associations. The associations of social media use with both muscularity dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were stronger for image-centric social media platforms (e.g., Instagram) than nonimage-centric platforms (e.g., Wordpress); no differences were observed for body fat dissatisfaction, height dissatisfaction, or thoughts about using anabolic steroids. Previously documented associations of social media use with body dissatisfaction and related variables among women and girls appear to generalize to sexual minority men. Social media platforms that more centrally involve imagery may be of greater concern than nonimage-centric platforms. Additional research with sexual minority men is needed to elucidate the distinctions between adaptive and maladaptive social media use in the context of body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and anabolic steroid use.},

In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.},

We draw on data from a research project that examines the interplay between promotion, drinking culture, and social media. In this project, informants documented flows of images between their social media accounts and a nightlife precinct. We show how the human capacity to use bodies to affect other bodies, and to make critical judgments about bodies, is vital to algorithmic media platforms that aim to profit from calculative judgements about the affective dimensions of human life. We propose an expanded register of “body heat” on social media as both the symbolic labor of producing, maintaining, and digitally mediating a body that conforms to heterosexy visual codes and the affective labor of using a hot body to affect other bodies through movement, touch, and excessive consumption. The escalating capacity of social media platforms to calibrate flows of attention depends on the “hot” bodies of users and user’s work in curating “hot” body images to upload. Hot female bodies are critical to nightlife promotion via social media, in attracting viewer attention. Hot female bodies are also key to moments of nightlife reconnaissance: they are registered in the databases and sorted by the algorithms of social media platforms, enabling viewers to make judgments about the desirability of locations in the nightlife precinct.},

However, there are few qualitative studies that have examined this issue, leaving the literature impoverished of the meaning of male body image to men. Specifically, there is a lack of discursive inquiry. Since romantic relationships provide a unique context for body image construction, the current study examines the ways in which men in relationships linguistically construct and negotiate the media’s influence on their own body image. Three interviews and a focus group of two men in heterosexual relationships were employed to explore this topic. Our results show that, while men speak of a negative influence of media on their body image, they do so in such a way that is adaptive and creates protective barriers between the self and the media’s messages. These strategies, which at times utilize relationship status, allow participants to construct general, albeit sometimes reluctant, satisfaction with their bodies. These findings, while largely concurring with previous literature, add caveats and may reconcile disparate results from past research by identifying contradictory constructions of media influence on males in heterosexual relationships.},

	abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unor ginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD007078.pub4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet is now an indispensable part of daily life for the majority of people in many parts of the world. It offers an additional means of effecting changes to behaviour such as smoking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register. There were no restrictions placed on language of publication or publication date. The most recent search was conducted in April 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials. Participants were people who smoked, with no exclusions based on age, gender, ethnicity, language or health status. Any type of Internet intervention was eligible. The comparison condition could be a no-intervention control, a different Internet intervention, or a non-Internet intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Methodological and study quality details were extracted using a standardized form. We extracted smoking cessation outcomes of six months follow-up or more, reporting short-term outcomes where longer-term outcomes were not available. We reported study effects as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95\% confidence interval (CI). Clinical and statistical heterogeneity limited our ability to pool studies. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review includes a total of 28 studies with over 45,000 participants. Some Internet programmes were intensive and included multiple outreach contacts with participants, whilst others relied on participants to initiate and maintain use.Fifteen trials compared an Internet intervention to a non-Internet-based smoking cessation intervention or to a no-intervention control. Ten of these recruited adults, one recruited young adult university students and two recruited adolescents. Seven of the trials in adults had follow-up at six months or longer and compared an Internet intervention to usual care or printed self help. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, pooled results from three trials that compared interactive and individually tailored interventions to usual care or written self help detected a statistically significant effect in favour of the intervention (RR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.11 to 2.78). However all three trials were judged to be at high risk of bias in one domain and high statistical heterogeneity was detected (I(2) = 53\%), with no obvious clinical explanation. Pooled results from two studies of an interactive, tailored intervention involving the Internet and automated phone contacts also detected a significant effect (RR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.42 to 2.97, I(2) = 42\%). Results from a sixth study comparing an interactive but non-tailored intervention to control did not detect a significant effect, nor did the seventh study, which compared a non-interactive, non-tailored intervention to control. Three trials comparing Internet interventions to face-to-face or phone counselling also did not detect evidence of an effect, nor did two trials evaluating Internet interventions as adjuncts to other behavioural interventions. A trial in college students increased point prevalence abstinence after 30 weeks but had no effect on sustained abstinence. Two small trials in adolescents did not detect an effect on cessation compared to control.Fourteen trials, all in adult populations, compared different Internet sites or programmes. Pooled estimates from three trials that compared tailored and/or interactive Internet programmes with non-tailored, non-interactive Internet programmes did not detect evidence of an effect (RR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.32, I(2) = 0\%). One trial detected evidence of a benefit from a tailored email compared to a non-tailored one, whereas a second trial comparing tailored messages to a non-tailored message did not detect evidence of an effect. Trials failed to detect a benefit of including a mood management component (three trials), or an asynchronous bulletin board. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that some Internet-based interventions can assist smoking cessation at six months or longer, particularly those which are interactive and tailored to individuals. However, the trials that compared Internet interventions with usual care or self help did not show consistent effects and were at risk of bias. Further research is needed despite 28 studies on the subject. Future studies should carefully consider optimising the interventions which promise most effect such as tailoring and interactivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid development of effective treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, insomnia management remains suboptimal at the practice interface. Patient preferences play a critical role in influencing treatment outcomes. However, there is currently a mismatch between patient preferences and clinician recommendations, partly perpetuated by a limited understanding of the patients' decision-making process. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to empirically quantify patient preferences for treatment attributes common to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological insomnia treatments. METHOD: An efficient dual-response discrete choice experiment was conducted to evaluate patient treatment preferences for managing insomnia. The sample included 205 patients with self-reported insomnia and an Insomnia Severity Index {\textgreater}/= 14. Participants were presented with two unlabelled hypothetical scenarios with an opt-out option across 12 choice sets. Data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model to investigate the influence of five attributes (i.e. time, onset of action, maintainability of improved sleep, length of treatment, and monthly cost) on treatment preferences. RESULTS: Treatments were preferentially viewed if they conferred long-term sleep benefits (p {\textless} 0.05); had an ongoing, as opposed to a predefined, duration of treatment course (p {\textless} 0.05); required some, as opposed to no, additional time commitment (p {\textless} 0.05); and had lower monthly out-of-pocket treatment costs (p {\textless} 0.001). However, treatment onset of action had no influence on preference. Age, help-seeking status, concession card status and fatigue severity significantly influenced treatment preference. CONCLUSION: Participants' prioritization of investing time in treatment and valuing the maintainability of therapeutic gains suggests a stronger inclination towards non-pharmacological treatment, defying current assumptions that patients prefer 'quick-fixes' for managing insomnia.},

	abstract = {Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical finding that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even though extant research has identified a variety of antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the findings of the individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding of when large assortments can benefit choice and when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N=7202) reported by prior research, we identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difficulty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and significant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difficulty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also find that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research—satisfaction/confidence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is significant—a finding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present ideas to help inform the future development and evaluation of decision aids. RESULTS: We suggest, (i) that the appropriateness of using any decision aid be assessed within the context of the wider decision-making encounter within which it is embedded; (ii) that goal setting activities drive measurement activities and not the other way round; (iii) that the rationale for and meaning of goals at the conceptual level, and mechanisms through which they are intended to have an impact be clearly thought through and made explicit; (iv) that value assumptions underlying both decision aids and associated values clarification exercises be communicated to patients; (v) that taxonomies developed and used to classify various types of decision aids include a section on value assumptions underlying each tool; (vi) that further debate and discussion take place on the role of explicit values clarification exercises as a component of or adjunct to treatment decision aids and the feasibility of implementing valid measures.

	abstract = {Quitting smoking is beneficial to health at any age, and cigarette smokers who quit before age 35 years have mortality rates similar to those who never smoked. From 1965 to 2010, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults in the United States decreased from 42.4\% to 19.3\%, in part because of an increase in the number who quit smoking. Since 2002, the number of former U.S. smokers has exceeded the number of current smokers. Mass media campaigns, increases in the prices of tobacco products, and smoke-free policies have been shown to increase smoking cessation. In addition, brief cessation advice by health-care providers; individual, group, and telephone counseling; and cessation medications are effective cessation treatments. To determine the prevalence of 1) current interest in quitting smoking, 2) successful recent smoking cessation, 3) recent use of cessation treatments, and 4) trends in quit attempts over a 10-year period, CDC analyzed data from the 2001--2010 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that, in 2010, 68.8\% of adult smokers wanted to stop smoking, 52.4\% had made a quit attempt in the past year, 6.2\% had recently quit, 48.3\% had been advised by a health professional to quit, and 31.7\% had used counseling and/or medications when they tried to quit. The prevalence of quit attempts increased during 2001--2010 among smokers aged 25--64 years, but not among other age groups. Health-care providers should identify smokers and offer them brief cessation advice at each visit; counseling and medication should be offered to patients willing to make a quit attempt.},

Twenty-one studies focused on e-cigarette use. Ever-use increased among various age groups. In 2011, ever-use was highest among young adults (college students and those aged 20-28; 4.9\%-7.0\%), followed by adults (aged {\textgreater}/=18; 0.6\%-6.2\%), and adolescents (grades 6-12 and aged 11-19; {\textless}1\%-3.3\%). However, in 2012 adolescent ever-use increased to 6.8\% and, among high school students, went as high as 10.0\%. While the identified common correlate of e-cigarette use was a history of cigarette smoking, a notable proportion of adolescents and young adults who never smoked cigarettes had ever-used e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use was not consistently associated with attempting to quit tobacco among young adults. Adults most often reported e-cigarettes as a substitute for tobacco, although not always to quit. Reviewed studies showed a somewhat different pattern of e-cigarette use among young people (new e-cigarette users who had never used tobacco) versus adults (former or current tobacco users). Research is needed to better characterize prevalences, use correlates, and motives of use in different population groups, including how adolescent and young adult experimentation with e-cigarettes relates to other types of substance use behaviors.},

We draw on data from a research project that examines the interplay between promotion, drinking culture, and social media. In this project, informants documented flows of images between their social media accounts and a nightlife precinct. We show how the human capacity to use bodies to affect other bodies, and to make critical judgments about bodies, is vital to algorithmic media platforms that aim to profit from calculative judgements about the affective dimensions of human life. We propose an expanded register of “body heat” on social media as both the symbolic labor of producing, maintaining, and digitally mediating a body that conforms to heterosexy visual codes and the affective labor of using a hot body to affect other bodies through movement, touch, and excessive consumption. The escalating capacity of social media platforms to calibrate flows of attention depends on the “hot” bodies of users and user’s work in curating “hot” body images to upload. Hot female bodies are critical to nightlife promotion via social media, in attracting viewer attention. Hot female bodies are also key to moments of nightlife reconnaissance: they are registered in the databases and sorted by the algorithms of social media platforms, enabling viewers to make judgments about the desirability of locations in the nightlife precinct.},

	abstract = {We present an encoding framework which exploits semantics for video content delivery. The video content is organized based on the idea of main content message. In the work reported in this paper, the main content message is extracted from the video data through semantic video analysis, an application-dependent process that separates relevant information from non relevant information. We use here semantic analysis and the corresponding content annotation under a new perspective: the results of the analysis are exploited for object-based encoders, such as MPEG-4, as well as for frame-based encoders, such as MPEG-1. Moreover, the use of MPEG-7 content descriptors in conjunction with the video is used for improving content visualization for narrow channels and devices with limited capabilities. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the impact of semantic video analysis in video encoding and show that the use of semantic video analysis prior to encoding sensibly reduces the bandwidth requirements compared to traditional encoders not only for an object-based encoder but also for a frame-based encoder.},

Overall, 74.7\% of adult current cigarette smokers used multiple quit methods during their most recent quit attempt. Giving up cigarettes all at once (65.3\%) and reducing the number of cigarettes smoked (62.0\%) were the most prevalent methods. Substituting some cigarettes with e-cigarettes was used by a greater percentage of smokers than the nicotine patch, nicotine gum, or other cessation aids approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Further research into the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid is warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quit and Win contests were developed in the 1980s by the Minnesota Heart Health Program, and have been widely used since then as a population-based smoking cessation intervention at local, national and international level. Since 1994 an international contest has been held every two years in as many as 80 countries (2002). OBJECTIVES: To determine whether quit and win contests can deliver higher long-term quit rates than baseline community quit rates.To assess the impact of such programmes, we considered both the quit rates achieved by participants, and the population impact, which takes into account the proportion of the target population entering the contest. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included competition*, quit and win, quit to win, contest*, prize*. Most recent search date was November 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomized controlled trials, allocating individuals or communities to experimental or control conditions. We also considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. We contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking for at least six months from the start of the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. We decided against performing a meta-analysis, because of the heterogeneity of the included studies, and the small number of scientifically valid studies. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met our inclusion criteria. Three demonstrated significantly higher quit rates (8\% to 20\%) for the quit and win group than for the control group at the 12-month assessment. However, the population impact measure, where available, suggests that the effect of contests on community prevalence of smoking is small, with fewer than one in 500 smokers quitting because of the contest. Levels of deception, where they could be quantified, were high. Although surveys suggest that international quit and win contests may be effective, especially in developing countries, the lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusions from this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Quit and win contests at local and regional level appear to deliver quit rates above baseline community rates, although the population impact of the contests seems to be relatively low. Contests may be subject to levels of deception which could compromise the validity of the intervention. International contests may prove to be an effective mechanism, particularly in developing countries, but a lack of well-designed comparative studies precludes any firm conclusions.},

This approach is especially useful for situations where a single knowledgeable coder will code all the transcripts once the coding scheme has been established.

	issn = {1361-6137},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD005353.pub4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonists may assist with smoking cessation by restoring the balance of the endocannabinoid system, which can be disrupted by prolonged use of nicotine. They also seeks to address many smokers' reluctance to persist with a quit attempt because of concerns about weight gain. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether selective CB1 receptor antagonists (currently rimonabant and taranabant) increase the numbers of people stopping smoking To assess their effects on weight change in successful quitters and in those who try to quit but fail. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register for trials, using the terms ('rimonabant' or 'taranabant') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, using major MESH terms. We acquired electronic or paper copies of posters of preliminary trial results presented at the American Thoracic Society Meeting in 2005, and at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco European Meeting 2006. We also attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies of rimonabant, and Sanofi Aventis (manufacturers of rimonabant). The most recent search was in January 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies Randomized controlled trialsTypes of participants Adult smokersTypes of interventions Selective CB1 receptor antagonists, such as rimonabant and taranabant. Types of outcome measures The primary outcome is smoking status at a minimum of six months after the start of treatment. We preferred sustained cessation rates to point prevalence, and biochemically verified cessation to self-reported quitting. We regarded smokers who drop out or are lost to follow up as continuing smokers. We have noted any adverse effects of treatment.A secondary outcome is weight change associated with the cessation attempt. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors checked the abstracts for relevance, and attempted to acquire full trial reports. One author extracted the data, and a second author checked them. MAIN RESULTS: We found three trials which met our inclusion criteria, covering 1567 smokers (cessation: STRATUS-EU and STRATUS-US), and 1661 quitters (relapse prevention: STRATUS-WW). At one year, the pooled risk ratio (RR) for quitting with rimonabant 20 mg was 1.50 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 2.05). No significant benefit was demonstrated for rimonabant at 5 mg dosage. Adverse events included nausea and upper respiratory tract infections. In the relapse prevention trial, smokers who had quit on the 20 mg regimen were more likely to remain abstinent on either active regimen than on placebo; the RR for the 20 mg maintenance group was 1.29 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.57), and for the 5 mg maintenance group 1.30 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.59). There appeared to be no significant benefit of maintenance treatment for the 5 mg quitters. One trial of taranabant was not included in our meta-analyses, as it followed participants only until end of treatment; at eight weeks it found no benefit for treatment over placebo, with an OR of 1.2 (90\% CI 0.6 to 2.5). For rimonabant, weight gain was reported to be significantly lower among the 20 mg quitters than in the 5 mg or placebo quitters. During treatment, overweight or obese smokers tended to lose weight, while normal weight smokers did not. For taranabant, weight gain was significantly lower for 2-8 mg versus placebo at the end of eight weeks of treatment. In 2008, post-marketing surveillance led the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) to require Sanofi Aventis to withdraw rimonabant, because of links to mental disorders. The development of taranabant was also suspended by Merck \& Co because of unacceptable adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: From the trial reports available, rimonabant 20 mg may increase the chances of quitting approximately 1(1/2)-fold. The evidence for rimonabant in maintaining abstinence is inconclusive. Rimonabant 20 mg may moderate weight gain in the long term. Taranabant 2-8 mg may moderate weight gain, at least in the short term. In 2008, development of both rimonabant and taranabant was discontinued by the manufacturers.},

	abstract = {Decision aids, sometimes known as decision-support tools, are increasingly used to help patients to understand treatment options and to reach an informed decision consistent with their own values, yet methods for their economic evaluation have received limited attention. This is at odds with the increasingly rigorous methods being applied to assess the cost effectiveness of other health technologies. This paper reviews current approaches to evaluating decision aids and proposes a new method for assessing their benefits relative to other interventions in a resource-constrained health system that seeks to improve health, equity and patient satisfaction. Current evaluation frameworks are found to be unsuitable for the economic evaluation of decision aids since their objectives are broader than health maximisation. Decision aids may generate significant non-health benefits such as improved patient knowledge and satisfaction, which cannot be assessed using cost-utility analysis. A stated-preference consultation time trade-off (CTTO) is proposed in which a proportion of hypothetical physician consultation is traded for use of the decision aid. A decision aid provides information for a patient to make an informed choice and therefore may be considered to be a substitute for physician time. The CTTO can be reported in consultation minutes or converted to monetary units using the cost of physician time. These values may be used, alongside the implementation cost, for economic evaluation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking prevalence is very high among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered and queer (LGBTQ+) youth and young adults (YYA) compared to non-LGBTQ+ YYA. A knowledge gap exists on culturally appropriate and effective prevention and cessation efforts for members of this diverse community, as limited interventions have been developed with and for this population, and there are very few studies determining the impact of these interventions. This study identifies the most salient elements of LGBTQ+ cessation and prevention interventions from the perspective of LGBTQ+ YYA. METHODS: Three descriptions of interventions tailored for LGBTQ+ YYA (group cessation counselling, social marketing, and a mobile phone app with social media incorporated), were shared with LGBTQ+ YYA via 24 focus groups with 204 participants in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Open-ended questions focused on their feelings, likes and dislikes, and concerns about the culturally modified intervention descriptions. Framework analysis was used to identify overarching themes across all three intervention descriptions. RESULTS: The data revealed eight overarching themes across all three intervention descriptions. Smoking cessation and prevention interventions should have the following key attributes: 1) be LGBTQ+ - specific; 2) be accessible in terms of location, time, availability, and cost; 3) be inclusive, relatable, and highlight diversity; 4) incorporate LGBTQ+ peer support and counselling services; 5) integrate other activities beyond smoking; 6) be positive, motivational, uplifting, and empowering; 7) provide concrete coping mechanisms; and 8) integrate rewards and incentives. CONCLUSIONS: LGBTQ+ YYA focus group participants expressed a desire for an intervention that can incorporate these key elements. The mobile phone app and social media campaign were noted as potential interventions that could include all the essential elements.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Background The college years are a critical time in the development of smoking behavior and tobacco use. Smoking is linked to 30\% of cancer deaths, 80\% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and early cardiovascular disease and death. Effective cessation interventions at this time provide an opportunity to drastically reduce premature morbidity and mortality. Aims To review available evidence on Internet interventions with young adults, including methodology, theoretical frameworks and outcome measures for tobacco treatment to guide the development of a program in college health. Methods A comprehensive literature search for studies published from January 1999 to February 2011, in multiple databases was conducted, along with hand?searching of reference lists. Inclusion criteria were: participants aged 18?30 years, intervention involved the Internet through either Web sites or e?mail or texting, and outcome measurement of tobacco cessation/abstinence. Studies were evaluated utilizing a tool synthesized from guidelines presented by the Cochrane Collaboration. Findings Eight studies met the inclusion criteria (four randomized controlled trials, four cohort studies). Theoretical frameworks utilized were the Transtheoretical Model of Change, Health Belief Model, Theory of Social Support, and social cognitive theory. Interventions varied and included computer?generated advice letters, Web?based cessation guides, computer?generated text messages, and peer e?mail support. With smoking abstinence as the primary outcome measure, there was a statistically significant improvement in quit rates. Because of the use of multiple components, differences in interventions and the number of contacts, it is not clear what types of computer?based applications are most effective. Small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and inconsistency in outcome measures limit the ability to provide conclusive evidence to support these interventions?but support the feasibility to use in the design of future programs. Conclusions Use of technology?based interventions, such as the Internet, may be an effective tool for tobacco treatment interventions, especially with college students. There is great potential to reach large numbers of students, many who may not identify themselves as smokers or seek traditional methods for treatment. Additional research is needed to determine which technology?based interventions are most effective and to provide more conclusive evidence.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about how individuals engage with electronic health (eHealth) interventions over time and whether this engagement predicts health outcomes. Objective: The objectives of this study, by using the example of a specific type of eHealth intervention (ie, websites for smoking cessation), were to determine (1) distinct groups of log-in trajectories over a 12-month period, (2) their association with smoking cessation, and (3) baseline user characteristics that predict trajectory group membership. Methods: We conducted a functional clustering analysis of 365 consecutive days of log-in data from both arms of a large (N=2637) randomized trial of 2 website interventions for smoking cessation (WebQuit and Smokefree), with a primary outcome of 30-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 12 months. We conducted analyses for each website separately. Results: A total of 3 distinct trajectory groups emerged for each website. For WebQuit, participants were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (682/1240, 55.00\% of the sample), 5-week users (399/1240, 32.18\%), and 52-week users (159/1240, 12.82\%). Compared with the 1-week users, the 5- and 52-week users had 57\% higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95\% CI 1.13-2.17; P=.007) and 124\% higher odds (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.45-3.43; P{\textless}.001), respectively, of being abstinent at 12 months. Smokefree users were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (645/1309, 49.27\% of the sample), 4-week users (395/1309, 30.18\%), and 5-week users (269/1309, 20.55\%). Compared with the 1-week users, 5-week users (but not 4-week users; P=.99) had 48\% higher odds (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.05-2.07; P=.02) of being abstinent at 12 months. In general, the WebQuit intervention had a greater number of weekly log-ins within each of the 3 trajectory groups as compared with those of the Smokefree intervention. Baseline characteristics associated with trajectory group membership varied between websites. Conclusions: Patterns of 1-, 4-, and 5-week usage of websites may be common for how people engage in eHealth interventions. The 5-week usage of either website, and 52-week usage only of WebQuit, predicted a higher odds of quitting smoking. Strategies to increase eHealth intervention engagement for 4 more weeks (ie, from 1 week to 5 weeks) could be highly cost effective.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Peer-to-peer interactions and support groups mitigate experiences of social isolation and loneliness often reported by individuals with psychotic disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication can promote broader use of this form of social support. Peer-to-peer interactions occur naturally on social media platforms, but they can negatively affect mental health. Recent digital interventions for persons with psychotic disorders have harnessed the principles of social media to incorporate peer-to-peer communication. This review examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of recent digital interventions in order to identify strategies to maximize benefits of online peer-to-peer communication for persons with psychotic disorders. METHODS: An electronic database search of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Health Technology Assessment Database was conducted in February 2017 and yielded a total of 1,015 results. Eight publications that reported data from six independent trials and five interventions were reviewed. RESULTS: The technology supporting peer-to-peer communication varied greatly across studies, from online forums to embedded social networking. When peer-to-peer interactions were moderated by facilitators, retention, engagement, acceptability, and efficacy were higher than for interventions with no facilitators. Individuals with psychotic disorders were actively engaged with moderated peer-to-peer communication and showed improvements in perceived social support. Studies involving service users in intervention design showed higher rates of acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with psychotic disorders value and benefit from digital interventions that include moderated peer-to-peer interactions. Incorporating peer-to-peer communication into digital interventions for this population may increase compliance with other evidence-based therapies by producing more acceptable and engaging online environments.},

The latest generation of smartphones is comparable to computers, allowing the development of new applications in health field. This paper aims to describe the use of smartphones by health professionals and patients in the field of health promotion. We conducted a bibliographic search through Pubmed. Then, research results were analyzed critically in order to select the best experiences available. All searches were carried out on November 2012 and were not limited by date. Each item from the initial search was reviewed independently by members of the project team. Initial search returned 472 items with PubMed. After the removal of duplicates, 406 items were reviewed by all the members of the project team and 21 articles were identified as specifically centered on health promotion. In the nutrition field there are applications that allow to count calories and keep a food diary or more specific platforms for people with food allergies, while about physical activity many applications suggest exercises with measurement of sports statistics. Some applications deal with lifestyles suggestions and tips. Finally, some positive experiences are reported in the prevention of falls in elderly and of sexually-transmitted diseases. Smartphones are transforming the ways of communication but the lack of monitoring of contents, the digital divide, the confidentiality of data, the exclusion of the health professional from the management of patient, are the main risks related to their use.},

	abstract = {Nicotine sustains tobacco addiction, a major cause of disability and premature death. Nicotine binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors, facilitating neurotransmitter release and thereby mediating the complex actions of nicotine in tobacco users. Dopamine, glutamate, and gamma aminobutyric acid release are particularly important in the development of nicotine dependence, and corticotropin-releasing factor appears to contribute to nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine dependence is highly heritable. Genetic studies indicate roles for nicotinic receptor subtypes, as well as genes involved in neuroplasticity and learning, in development of dependence. Nicotine is primarily metabolized byCYP2A6, and variability in rate of metabolism contributes to vulnerability to tobacco dependence, response to smoking cessation treatment, and lung cancer risk. Tobacco addiction is much more common in persons with mental illness and substance abuse disorders, representing a high proportion of current smokers. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches to tobacco addiction include nicotine replacement, bupropion, and varenicline, the latter a selective nicotine receptor partial agonist.},

This study examined whether intervention design qualities predict user adherence to behavioral eHealth interventions in real-world use and which qualities matter the most. We correlated the online activities of users of 30 web-based behavioral interventions—collected from a proprietary data set of anonymized logs from consenting users of Microsoft Internet Explorer add-on—with interventions’ quality ratings obtained by trained raters prior to empirical examination. The quality ratings included: Usability, Visual Design, User Engagement, Content, Therapeutic Persuasiveness (i.e., persuasive design and incorporation of behavior change techniques), and Therapeutic Alliance. We found Therapeutic Persuasiveness (i.e., the incorporation of persuasive design/behavior change principles) to be the most robust predictor of adherence (i.e., duration of use, number of unique sessions; 40 ≤ rs ≤ .58, ps ≤ .005), explaining 42\% of the variance in user adherence in our regression model. Results indicated up to six times difference in the percentage of users utilizing the interventions for more than a minimum amount of time and sessions based on Therapeutic Persuasiveness. Findings suggest the importance of persuasive design and behavior change techniques incorporation during the design and evaluation of digital behavioral interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Emerging evidence supports the use of smartphone apps for smoking cessation, especially in young adults given their high smoking rates and high smartphone ownership rates. Although evaluative evidence is encouraging for supporting smoking cessation, there remains a paucity of research describing the design and development processes of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Objective: The aim of this paper was to describe the process of developing Crush the Crave (CTC), an evidence-informed app to support smoking cessation in young adults, and the results of a formative evaluation of app usage behavior, as part of a broader program of research that seeks to establish the effectiveness of the CTC app. Methods: The Spiral Technology Action Research (STAR) 5-cycle model (listen, plan, do, act, and study) was employed to guide the development, implementation, and dissemination of CTC. The approach to development and formative evaluation included focus groups with young adult smokers (n=78) across 2 phases, analysis of the content of existing apps, 2 sessions with content experts, and Google Analytics to assess user behavior during a 12-month pilot. Results: LISTEN?focus groups revealed young adult smoker preferences of (1) positive reinforcement, (2) personalization, (3) social support, (4) quit support, (5) tracking the behavior, and (6) tracking quit benefits. PLAN?informed by evidence for smoking cessation, young adult preferences and an assessment of popular cessation apps, content experts produced a mind map and a storyboard describing app content and structure. DO?focus groups with young adult smokers provided feedback on the first version of the app with opinions on content and suggestions for improvement such as providing alerts and distractions from craving. ACT?refinements were made, and app content was organized using the 4 key design components informed by principles of persuasive technology for behavior change: credibility, task support, dialogue support, and social support. CTC was launched in April 2013 and piloted from the period July 2013 to June 2014 where 1987 Android users had 18,567 sessions, resulting in 59,384 page views and 89.58\% (1780/1987) of users returning within the same day to use CTC. STUDY?a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of CTC was launched in August 2014 to demonstrate that including mHealth technology as a population-based intervention can help young adult smokers to quit. The results of this phase will be presented in a subsequent publication. Conclusions: CTC is one of the first smoking cessation apps designed to meet the needs of young adult smokers. The development was informed by the inclusion of young adults in the design and the systematic application of multiple stakeholder input, scientific evidence, and theory. The STAR model approach was followed from the beginning of intervention development, which should facilitate optimization of mHealth interventions in the future.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is considered to have a beneficial influence on executive functioning, including decision-making. Enhanced decision-making after bariatric surgery may strengthen patients' ability to delay gratification, helping to establish appropriate eating behavior. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare a preoperative group with a postoperative group with regard to daily PA, decision-making, and eating disturbances; and (2) investigate the relationship between these variables. METHODS: The study included 71 bariatric surgery candidates (78 \% women, BMI [kg/m(2)] M = 46.9, SD = 6.0) and 73 postoperative patients (78 \% women, BMI M = 32.0, SD = 4.1; 89 \% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 11 \% sleeve gastrectomy; months postoperative M = 8.2, SD = 3.5; total weight loss [\%] M = 33.2, SD = 8.9) who completed SenseWear Pro2 activity monitoring. Decision-making was assessed using a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task and eating disorder psychopathology using the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. RESULTS: The number of patients who were classified as physically inactive was similarly high in the pre- and postoperative groups. No group differences emerged with regard to decision-making, but the postoperative group exhibited less eating disturbances than the preoperative group. No significant associations were found between PA, decision-making, and eating behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Patients after bariatric surgery were not more physically active than bariatric surgery candidates, which should be considered in care programs. Additionally, future research is needed to explore the possible link between PA, patients' decision-making abilities, and eating disturbances concerning dose-response questions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is proposed to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke or strengthen the will to stop. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register and the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, SCI, SSCI using the terms smoking cessation and hypnotherapy or hypnosis. Date of most recent searches July 2010. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomized controlled trials of hypnotherapy which reported smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of the hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. They also independently assessed the quality of the included studies.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Those lost to follow up were considered to be smoking. We summarised effects as risk ratios (RR). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven studies compared hypnotherapy with 18 different control interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between the results of the individual studies, with conflicting results for the effectiveness of hypnotherapy compared to no treatment, or to advice, or psychological treatment. We did not attempt to calculate pooled risk ratios for the overall effect of hypnotherapy. There was no evidence of a greater effect of hypnotherapy when compared to rapid smoking or psychological treatment. Direct comparisons of hypnotherapy with cessation treatments considered to be effective had confidence intervals that were too wide to infer equivalence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six-month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment. There is not enough evidence to show whether hypnotherapy could be as effective as counselling treatment. The effects of hypnotherapy on smoking cessation claimed by uncontrolled studies were not confirmed by analysis of randomized controlled trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) has been identified as a risk factor for lung cancer for three decades. It is also known that the lung continues to grow from birth to adulthood, when lung growth stops. We hypothesize that after adjusting for active cigarette smoking, if SHS exposure took place during the period of growth, i.e. in the earlier part of life (0-25 years of age) the risk of lung cancer is greater compared to an exposure occurring after age 25. METHOD: Second hand smoke exposure was self-reported for three different activities (leisure, work and at home) for this study population of 1669 cases and 1263 controls. We created variables that captured location of exposure and timing of first exposure with respect to a study participant's age (0-25, {\textgreater}25 years of age). Multiple logistic regressions were used to study the association between SHS exposure and lung cancer, adjusting for age, gender and active smoking variables. RESULT: For study participants that were exposed to SHS at both activities (work and leisure) and compared to one or no activity, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for lung cancer was 1.30 (1.08-1.57) when exposure occurred between birth and age 25 and 0.66 (0.21-1.57) if exposure occurred after age 25 years. Respective results for non-smokers were 1.29 (0.82-2.02) and 0.87 (0.22-3.38), and current and ex-smokers combined 1.28 (1.04-1.58) and 0.66 (0.15-2.85). CONCLUSION: All individuals exposed to SHS have a higher risk of lung cancer. Furthermore, this study suggests that subjects first exposed before age 25 have a higher lung cancer risk compared to those for whom first exposure occurred after age 25 years.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that men, like women, are negatively affected by idealized media portrayals. However, there are few qualitative studies that have examined this issue, leaving the literature impoverished of the meaning of male body image to men. Specifically, there is a lack of discursive inquiry. Since romantic relationships provide a unique context for body image construction, the current study examines the ways in which men in relationships linguistically construct and negotiate the media’s influence on their own body image. Three interviews and a focus group of two men in heterosexual relationships were employed to explore this topic. Our results show that, while men speak of a negative influence of media on their body image, they do so in such a way that is adaptive and creates protective barriers between the self and the media’s messages. These strategies, which at times utilize relationship status, allow participants to construct general, albeit sometimes reluctant, satisfaction with their bodies. These findings, while largely concurring with previous literature, add caveats and may reconcile disparate results from past research by identifying contradictory constructions of media influence on males in heterosexual relationships.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successful recruitment of participants to mobile health (mHealth) studies presents unique challenges over in-person studies. It is important to identify recruitment strategies that maximize the limited recruitment resources available to researchers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe a case study of a unique recruitment process used in a recent mHealth software app designed to increase smoking cessation among weight-concerned women smokers. The See Me Smoke-Free app was deployed to the Google Play Store (Alphabet, Inc., Google, LLC), where potential participants could download the app and enroll in the study. Users were invited in-app to participate in the study, with no in-person contact. The recruitment activities relied primarily on earned (free) and social media. METHODS: To determine the relationship between recruitment activities and participant enrollment, the researchers explored trends in earned and social media activity in relation to app installations, examined social media messaging in relation to reach or impressions, and described app users' self-reported referral source. The researchers collected and descriptively analyzed data regarding recruitment activities, social media audience, and app use during the 18-week recruitment period (March 30, 2015-July 31, 2015). Data were collected and aggregated from internal staff activity tracking documents and from Web-based data analytics software such as SumAll, Facebook Insights (Facebook, Inc.), and Google Analytics (Alphabet, Inc., Google, LLC). RESULTS: Media coverage was documented across 75 publications and radio or television broadcasts, 35 of which were local, 39 national, and 1 international. The research team made 30 Facebook posts and 49 tweets, yielding 1821 reaches and 6336 impressions, respectively. From March 30, 2015 to July 31, 2015, 289 unique users downloaded the app, and 151 participants enrolled in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Research identifying effective online recruitment methods for mHealth studies remains minimal, and findings are inconsistent. We demonstrated how earned media can be leveraged to recruit women to an mHealth smoking cessation trial at low cost. Using earned media and leveraging social media allowed us to enroll 3 times the number of participants that we anticipated enrolling. The cost of earned media resides in the staff time required to manage it, particularly the regular interaction with social media. We recommend communication and cooperation with university public affairs and social media offices, as well as affiliate programs in journalism and communications, so that earned media can be used as a recruitment strategy for mHealth behavior change interventions. However, press releases are not always picked up by the media and should not be considered as a stand-alone method of recruitment. Careful consideration of an intervention's broad appeal and how that translates into potential media interest is needed when including earned media as part of a comprehensive recruitment plan for mHealth research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of preventable illness in the United States and around the world. However, much remains unknown about the factors that motivate individuals to smoke. Quality of life (QoL) has become an important measure of outcomes across all medical specialties, in both research and clinical settings. To date, there has not been a critical review of the research relevant to QoL in smokers. In this review, we describe which scales are used to quantify the QoL of smokers, the relationship between smoking and QoL and the positive impact of smoking cessation. METHODS: Fifty-four relevant studies are included in our review. RESULTS: Low QoL and depression are associated with higher odds of smoking initiation and lower odds of successful smoking cessation. There is a negative relationship between smoking and QoL and the magnitude of this association is related to the number of cigarettes smoked. Secondhand smoke also appears to be negatively associated with QoL. Smoking cessation significantly improves QoL. These findings have been replicated across populations with diverse socioeconomic and cultural groups around the world. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: QoL data promotes smokers and practitioners to become more sensitive to the sub-clinical adverse effects of cigarette smoking, thereby improving motivation to quit, cessation rates, and treatment outcomes. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the relationship between QoL and tobacco smoking is important for patients, clinicians, and researchers.},

Nevertheless, evidence that this might be the case was beginning to appear, and some researchers became increasingly interested in investigating the importance of nicotine in the smoking habit and educating the public about it. The research led to a profound change in the understanding of cigarette smoking, and in 1988, the U.S. Surgeon General, in the remarkable book Nicotine Addiction, established once and “forever” the importance of nicotine in tobacco smoking (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [U.S. DHHS], 1988). However, as the role of nicotine was established, researchers lost sight of the possibility that other determinants might also be important. More recently, it has been found that, although nicotine is the most important addictive component of tobacco smoke, it is probably not the only substance involved in the development of tobacco dependence. In light of what is now known about what determines cigarette smoking, it seems timely to propose a renaming of the FTND to the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD). The background for this is discussed in this commentary.},

Three main factors determine the public health impact of electronic cigarettes: (1) their safety/risk profile, both relative to smoking and in absolute terms; (2) their effectiveness for smoking reduction and cessation; (3) the patterns of use by different population subgroups, especially never-smokers, and adoption of use by youth.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Practice nurses in general practices suboptimally adhere to smoking cessation guidelines. Since the effectiveness of their smoking cessation support is greatest when full adherence to these guidelines is achieved, interventions need to be developed to improve practice nurses' guideline adherence, for example, by tailoring their content to adherence determinants. However, the sociocognitive determinants explaining adherence have not yet been investigated. Therefore, this qualitative needs assessment aimed to explore practice nurses' current counselling practices, as well as their sociocognitive beliefs related to their smoking cessation guideline adherence and their needs regarding web-based adherence support. SETTING: Primary care; general practices in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 19 practice nurses, actively involved in smoking cessation counselling. METHODS: Semistructured individual interviews, based on the I-Change Model and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory, were conducted from May to September 2014. Data were systematically analysed using the Framework Method and considered reliable (kappa 0.77; \% agreement 99\%). RESULTS: Respondents felt able to be empathic and collaborative during smoking cessation consultations. They also reported psychological (eg, low self-efficacy to increase patient motivation and arranging adequate follow-up consultations) and practical barriers (eg, outdated information on quit support compensation and a perceived lack of high-quality trainings for practice nurses) to smoking cessation guideline adherence. Most respondents were interested in web-based adherence support to overcome these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Sociocognitive determinants influence practice nurses' smoking cessation guideline adherence. To improve their adherence, web-based tailored adherence support can provide practice nurses with personally relevant feedback tailored to individually perceived barriers to smoking cessation guideline adherence. More specifically, low self-efficacy levels can be increased by peer modelling (eg, presenting narratives of colleagues) and up-to-date information can be presented online, enabling practice nurses to use it during patient consultations, resulting in more effective communication with their smoking patients.

	abstract = {Quitting smoking is beneficial to health at any age, and cigarette smokers who quit before age 35 years have mortality rates similar to those who never smoked. From 1965 to 2010, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults in the United States decreased from 42.4\% to 19.3\%, in part because of an increase in the number who quit smoking. Since 2002, the number of former U.S. smokers has exceeded the number of current smokers. Mass media campaigns, increases in the prices of tobacco products, and smoke-free policies have been shown to increase smoking cessation. In addition, brief cessation advice by health-care providers; individual, group, and telephone counseling; and cessation medications are effective cessation treatments. To determine the prevalence of 1) current interest in quitting smoking, 2) successful recent smoking cessation, 3) recent use of cessation treatments, and 4) trends in quit attempts over a 10-year period, CDC analyzed data from the 2001--2010 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that, in 2010, 68.8\% of adult smokers wanted to stop smoking, 52.4\% had made a quit attempt in the past year, 6.2\% had recently quit, 48.3\% had been advised by a health professional to quit, and 31.7\% had used counseling and/or medications when they tried to quit. The prevalence of quit attempts increased during 2001--2010 among smokers aged 25--64 years, but not among other age groups. Health-care providers should identify smokers and offer them brief cessation advice at each visit; counseling and medication should be offered to patients willing to make a quit attempt.},

Twenty-one studies focused on e-cigarette use. Ever-use increased among various age groups. In 2011, ever-use was highest among young adults (college students and those aged 20-28; 4.9\%-7.0\%), followed by adults (aged {\textgreater}/=18; 0.6\%-6.2\%), and adolescents (grades 6-12 and aged 11-19; {\textless}1\%-3.3\%). However, in 2012 adolescent ever-use increased to 6.8\% and, among high school students, went as high as 10.0\%. While the identified common correlate of e-cigarette use was a history of cigarette smoking, a notable proportion of adolescents and young adults who never smoked cigarettes had ever-used e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use was not consistently associated with attempting to quit tobacco among young adults. Adults most often reported e-cigarettes as a substitute for tobacco, although not always to quit. Reviewed studies showed a somewhat different pattern of e-cigarette use among young people (new e-cigarette users who had never used tobacco) versus adults (former or current tobacco users). Research is needed to better characterize prevalences, use correlates, and motives of use in different population groups, including how adolescent and young adult experimentation with e-cigarettes relates to other types of substance use behaviors.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD005353.pub4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonists may assist with smoking cessation by restoring the balance of the endocannabinoid system, which can be disrupted by prolonged use of nicotine. They also seeks to address many smokers' reluctance to persist with a quit attempt because of concerns about weight gain. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether selective CB1 receptor antagonists (currently rimonabant and taranabant) increase the numbers of people stopping smoking To assess their effects on weight change in successful quitters and in those who try to quit but fail. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register for trials, using the terms ('rimonabant' or 'taranabant') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, using major MESH terms. We acquired electronic or paper copies of posters of preliminary trial results presented at the American Thoracic Society Meeting in 2005, and at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco European Meeting 2006. We also attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies of rimonabant, and Sanofi Aventis (manufacturers of rimonabant). The most recent search was in January 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies Randomized controlled trialsTypes of participants Adult smokersTypes of interventions Selective CB1 receptor antagonists, such as rimonabant and taranabant. Types of outcome measures The primary outcome is smoking status at a minimum of six months after the start of treatment. We preferred sustained cessation rates to point prevalence, and biochemically verified cessation to self-reported quitting. We regarded smokers who drop out or are lost to follow up as continuing smokers. We have noted any adverse effects of treatment.A secondary outcome is weight change associated with the cessation attempt. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors checked the abstracts for relevance, and attempted to acquire full trial reports. One author extracted the data, and a second author checked them. MAIN RESULTS: We found three trials which met our inclusion criteria, covering 1567 smokers (cessation: STRATUS-EU and STRATUS-US), and 1661 quitters (relapse prevention: STRATUS-WW). At one year, the pooled risk ratio (RR) for quitting with rimonabant 20 mg was 1.50 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 2.05). No significant benefit was demonstrated for rimonabant at 5 mg dosage. Adverse events included nausea and upper respiratory tract infections. In the relapse prevention trial, smokers who had quit on the 20 mg regimen were more likely to remain abstinent on either active regimen than on placebo; the RR for the 20 mg maintenance group was 1.29 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.57), and for the 5 mg maintenance group 1.30 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.59). There appeared to be no significant benefit of maintenance treatment for the 5 mg quitters. One trial of taranabant was not included in our meta-analyses, as it followed participants only until end of treatment; at eight weeks it found no benefit for treatment over placebo, with an OR of 1.2 (90\% CI 0.6 to 2.5). For rimonabant, weight gain was reported to be significantly lower among the 20 mg quitters than in the 5 mg or placebo quitters. During treatment, overweight or obese smokers tended to lose weight, while normal weight smokers did not. For taranabant, weight gain was significantly lower for 2-8 mg versus placebo at the end of eight weeks of treatment. In 2008, post-marketing surveillance led the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) to require Sanofi Aventis to withdraw rimonabant, because of links to mental disorders. The development of taranabant was also suspended by Merck \& Co because of unacceptable adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: From the trial reports available, rimonabant 20 mg may increase the chances of quitting approximately 1(1/2)-fold. The evidence for rimonabant in maintaining abstinence is inconclusive. Rimonabant 20 mg may moderate weight gain in the long term. Taranabant 2-8 mg may moderate weight gain, at least in the short term. In 2008, development of both rimonabant and taranabant was discontinued by the manufacturers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quit and Win contests were developed in the 1980s by the Minnesota Heart Health Program, and have been widely used since then as a population-based smoking cessation intervention at local, national and international level. Since 1994 an international contest has been held every two years in as many as 80 countries (2002). OBJECTIVES: To determine whether quit and win contests can deliver higher long-term quit rates than baseline community quit rates.To assess the impact of such programmes, we considered both the quit rates achieved by participants, and the population impact, which takes into account the proportion of the target population entering the contest. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included competition*, quit and win, quit to win, contest*, prize*. Most recent search date was November 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomized controlled trials, allocating individuals or communities to experimental or control conditions. We also considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. We contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking for at least six months from the start of the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. We decided against performing a meta-analysis, because of the heterogeneity of the included studies, and the small number of scientifically valid studies. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met our inclusion criteria. Three demonstrated significantly higher quit rates (8\% to 20\%) for the quit and win group than for the control group at the 12-month assessment. However, the population impact measure, where available, suggests that the effect of contests on community prevalence of smoking is small, with fewer than one in 500 smokers quitting because of the contest. Levels of deception, where they could be quantified, were high. Although surveys suggest that international quit and win contests may be effective, especially in developing countries, the lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusions from this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Quit and win contests at local and regional level appear to deliver quit rates above baseline community rates, although the population impact of the contests seems to be relatively low. Contests may be subject to levels of deception which could compromise the validity of the intervention. International contests may prove to be an effective mechanism, particularly in developing countries, but a lack of well-designed comparative studies precludes any firm conclusions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking prevalence is very high among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered and queer (LGBTQ+) youth and young adults (YYA) compared to non-LGBTQ+ YYA. A knowledge gap exists on culturally appropriate and effective prevention and cessation efforts for members of this diverse community, as limited interventions have been developed with and for this population, and there are very few studies determining the impact of these interventions. This study identifies the most salient elements of LGBTQ+ cessation and prevention interventions from the perspective of LGBTQ+ YYA. METHODS: Three descriptions of interventions tailored for LGBTQ+ YYA (group cessation counselling, social marketing, and a mobile phone app with social media incorporated), were shared with LGBTQ+ YYA via 24 focus groups with 204 participants in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada. Open-ended questions focused on their feelings, likes and dislikes, and concerns about the culturally modified intervention descriptions. Framework analysis was used to identify overarching themes across all three intervention descriptions. RESULTS: The data revealed eight overarching themes across all three intervention descriptions. Smoking cessation and prevention interventions should have the following key attributes: 1) be LGBTQ+ - specific; 2) be accessible in terms of location, time, availability, and cost; 3) be inclusive, relatable, and highlight diversity; 4) incorporate LGBTQ+ peer support and counselling services; 5) integrate other activities beyond smoking; 6) be positive, motivational, uplifting, and empowering; 7) provide concrete coping mechanisms; and 8) integrate rewards and incentives. CONCLUSIONS: LGBTQ+ YYA focus group participants expressed a desire for an intervention that can incorporate these key elements. The mobile phone app and social media campaign were noted as potential interventions that could include all the essential elements.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Background The college years are a critical time in the development of smoking behavior and tobacco use. Smoking is linked to 30\% of cancer deaths, 80\% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and early cardiovascular disease and death. Effective cessation interventions at this time provide an opportunity to drastically reduce premature morbidity and mortality. Aims To review available evidence on Internet interventions with young adults, including methodology, theoretical frameworks and outcome measures for tobacco treatment to guide the development of a program in college health. Methods A comprehensive literature search for studies published from January 1999 to February 2011, in multiple databases was conducted, along with hand?searching of reference lists. Inclusion criteria were: participants aged 18?30 years, intervention involved the Internet through either Web sites or e?mail or texting, and outcome measurement of tobacco cessation/abstinence. Studies were evaluated utilizing a tool synthesized from guidelines presented by the Cochrane Collaboration. Findings Eight studies met the inclusion criteria (four randomized controlled trials, four cohort studies). Theoretical frameworks utilized were the Transtheoretical Model of Change, Health Belief Model, Theory of Social Support, and social cognitive theory. Interventions varied and included computer?generated advice letters, Web?based cessation guides, computer?generated text messages, and peer e?mail support. With smoking abstinence as the primary outcome measure, there was a statistically significant improvement in quit rates. Because of the use of multiple components, differences in interventions and the number of contacts, it is not clear what types of computer?based applications are most effective. Small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and inconsistency in outcome measures limit the ability to provide conclusive evidence to support these interventions?but support the feasibility to use in the design of future programs. Conclusions Use of technology?based interventions, such as the Internet, may be an effective tool for tobacco treatment interventions, especially with college students. There is great potential to reach large numbers of students, many who may not identify themselves as smokers or seek traditional methods for treatment. Additional research is needed to determine which technology?based interventions are most effective and to provide more conclusive evidence.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about how individuals engage with electronic health (eHealth) interventions over time and whether this engagement predicts health outcomes. Objective: The objectives of this study, by using the example of a specific type of eHealth intervention (ie, websites for smoking cessation), were to determine (1) distinct groups of log-in trajectories over a 12-month period, (2) their association with smoking cessation, and (3) baseline user characteristics that predict trajectory group membership. Methods: We conducted a functional clustering analysis of 365 consecutive days of log-in data from both arms of a large (N=2637) randomized trial of 2 website interventions for smoking cessation (WebQuit and Smokefree), with a primary outcome of 30-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 12 months. We conducted analyses for each website separately. Results: A total of 3 distinct trajectory groups emerged for each website. For WebQuit, participants were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (682/1240, 55.00\% of the sample), 5-week users (399/1240, 32.18\%), and 52-week users (159/1240, 12.82\%). Compared with the 1-week users, the 5- and 52-week users had 57\% higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95\% CI 1.13-2.17; P=.007) and 124\% higher odds (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.45-3.43; P{\textless}.001), respectively, of being abstinent at 12 months. Smokefree users were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (645/1309, 49.27\% of the sample), 4-week users (395/1309, 30.18\%), and 5-week users (269/1309, 20.55\%). Compared with the 1-week users, 5-week users (but not 4-week users; P=.99) had 48\% higher odds (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.05-2.07; P=.02) of being abstinent at 12 months. In general, the WebQuit intervention had a greater number of weekly log-ins within each of the 3 trajectory groups as compared with those of the Smokefree intervention. Baseline characteristics associated with trajectory group membership varied between websites. Conclusions: Patterns of 1-, 4-, and 5-week usage of websites may be common for how people engage in eHealth interventions. The 5-week usage of either website, and 52-week usage only of WebQuit, predicted a higher odds of quitting smoking. Strategies to increase eHealth intervention engagement for 4 more weeks (ie, from 1 week to 5 weeks) could be highly cost effective.

	abstract = {Nicotine sustains tobacco addiction, a major cause of disability and premature death. Nicotine binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors, facilitating neurotransmitter release and thereby mediating the complex actions of nicotine in tobacco users. Dopamine, glutamate, and gamma aminobutyric acid release are particularly important in the development of nicotine dependence, and corticotropin-releasing factor appears to contribute to nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine dependence is highly heritable. Genetic studies indicate roles for nicotinic receptor subtypes, as well as genes involved in neuroplasticity and learning, in development of dependence. Nicotine is primarily metabolized byCYP2A6, and variability in rate of metabolism contributes to vulnerability to tobacco dependence, response to smoking cessation treatment, and lung cancer risk. Tobacco addiction is much more common in persons with mental illness and substance abuse disorders, representing a high proportion of current smokers. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches to tobacco addiction include nicotine replacement, bupropion, and varenicline, the latter a selective nicotine receptor partial agonist.},

	abstract = {Background: Emerging evidence supports the use of smartphone apps for smoking cessation, especially in young adults given their high smoking rates and high smartphone ownership rates. Although evaluative evidence is encouraging for supporting smoking cessation, there remains a paucity of research describing the design and development processes of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Objective: The aim of this paper was to describe the process of developing Crush the Crave (CTC), an evidence-informed app to support smoking cessation in young adults, and the results of a formative evaluation of app usage behavior, as part of a broader program of research that seeks to establish the effectiveness of the CTC app. Methods: The Spiral Technology Action Research (STAR) 5-cycle model (listen, plan, do, act, and study) was employed to guide the development, implementation, and dissemination of CTC. The approach to development and formative evaluation included focus groups with young adult smokers (n=78) across 2 phases, analysis of the content of existing apps, 2 sessions with content experts, and Google Analytics to assess user behavior during a 12-month pilot. Results: LISTEN?focus groups revealed young adult smoker preferences of (1) positive reinforcement, (2) personalization, (3) social support, (4) quit support, (5) tracking the behavior, and (6) tracking quit benefits. PLAN?informed by evidence for smoking cessation, young adult preferences and an assessment of popular cessation apps, content experts produced a mind map and a storyboard describing app content and structure. DO?focus groups with young adult smokers provided feedback on the first version of the app with opinions on content and suggestions for improvement such as providing alerts and distractions from craving. ACT?refinements were made, and app content was organized using the 4 key design components informed by principles of persuasive technology for behavior change: credibility, task support, dialogue support, and social support. CTC was launched in April 2013 and piloted from the period July 2013 to June 2014 where 1987 Android users had 18,567 sessions, resulting in 59,384 page views and 89.58\% (1780/1987) of users returning within the same day to use CTC. STUDY?a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of CTC was launched in August 2014 to demonstrate that including mHealth technology as a population-based intervention can help young adult smokers to quit. The results of this phase will be presented in a subsequent publication. Conclusions: CTC is one of the first smoking cessation apps designed to meet the needs of young adult smokers. The development was informed by the inclusion of young adults in the design and the systematic application of multiple stakeholder input, scientific evidence, and theory. The STAR model approach was followed from the beginning of intervention development, which should facilitate optimization of mHealth interventions in the future.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is proposed to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke or strengthen the will to stop. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register and the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, SCI, SSCI using the terms smoking cessation and hypnotherapy or hypnosis. Date of most recent searches July 2010. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomized controlled trials of hypnotherapy which reported smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of the hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. They also independently assessed the quality of the included studies.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Those lost to follow up were considered to be smoking. We summarised effects as risk ratios (RR). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven studies compared hypnotherapy with 18 different control interventions. There was significant heterogeneity between the results of the individual studies, with conflicting results for the effectiveness of hypnotherapy compared to no treatment, or to advice, or psychological treatment. We did not attempt to calculate pooled risk ratios for the overall effect of hypnotherapy. There was no evidence of a greater effect of hypnotherapy when compared to rapid smoking or psychological treatment. Direct comparisons of hypnotherapy with cessation treatments considered to be effective had confidence intervals that were too wide to infer equivalence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six-month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment. There is not enough evidence to show whether hypnotherapy could be as effective as counselling treatment. The effects of hypnotherapy on smoking cessation claimed by uncontrolled studies were not confirmed by analysis of randomized controlled trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) has been identified as a risk factor for lung cancer for three decades. It is also known that the lung continues to grow from birth to adulthood, when lung growth stops. We hypothesize that after adjusting for active cigarette smoking, if SHS exposure took place during the period of growth, i.e. in the earlier part of life (0-25 years of age) the risk of lung cancer is greater compared to an exposure occurring after age 25. METHOD: Second hand smoke exposure was self-reported for three different activities (leisure, work and at home) for this study population of 1669 cases and 1263 controls. We created variables that captured location of exposure and timing of first exposure with respect to a study participant's age (0-25, {\textgreater}25 years of age). Multiple logistic regressions were used to study the association between SHS exposure and lung cancer, adjusting for age, gender and active smoking variables. RESULT: For study participants that were exposed to SHS at both activities (work and leisure) and compared to one or no activity, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for lung cancer was 1.30 (1.08-1.57) when exposure occurred between birth and age 25 and 0.66 (0.21-1.57) if exposure occurred after age 25 years. Respective results for non-smokers were 1.29 (0.82-2.02) and 0.87 (0.22-3.38), and current and ex-smokers combined 1.28 (1.04-1.58) and 0.66 (0.15-2.85). CONCLUSION: All individuals exposed to SHS have a higher risk of lung cancer. Furthermore, this study suggests that subjects first exposed before age 25 have a higher lung cancer risk compared to those for whom first exposure occurred after age 25 years.},

Autonomous motivation and perceived competence were assessed at baseline and 6 months, and the autonomy supportiveness of clinical practitioners was assessed at 3 months. Perceptions of autonomy and competence were promoted by perceived autonomy support, and changes in perceptions of autonomy and competence, in turn, predicted change in glycemic control. Self-management behaviors mediated the relation between change in perceived competence and change in glycemic control. The self-determination process model fit the data well.},

	issn = {1072-4710 (Print) 1072-4710},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the self-determination model of health-related behavior by examining whether the degree to which adolescents experience an appeal to not smoke as autonomy supportive would affect their autonomous motivation for not smoking and, in turn, their behavior of either refraining from smoking or smoking less, and to validate the measures of perceived autonomy support and autonomous motivation for not smoking. DESIGN: Two studies of physicians presenting information about not smoking using 2 message styles, 1 of which was designed to be more autonomy supportive. The preliminary study involved nonrandomized assignment to message style and only immediate assessment of perceptions, motivation, and behavior, while the primary study involved randomized assignment and 4-month longitudinal assessments. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nearly 400 ninth- through 12th-grade students at 2 suburban high schools in upstate New York. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adolescents' perceptions of the presentations' autonomy supportiveness of the presenters, as well as adolescents' autonomous motivation for not smoking and their self-reports of smoking. The primary study also assessed change in students' autonomous motivation and change in their self-reported smoking during 4 months. RESULTS: In both studies, the measures were reliable and valid. Students perceived significantly (P = .04 and P{\textless}.001, respectively) greater autonomy support in the "It's Your Choice" presentation, after controlling for whether the students were smokers. Perceived autonomy supportiveness of the presentation was positively correlated with autonomous reasons for not smoking in the preliminary study and with increases in autonomous motivation for not smoking in the primary study. Change in autonomous reasons for not smoking significantly (P{\textless}.001) predicted reduction in smoking during 4 months. CONCLUSION: When adolescents perceived messages about not smoking as autonomy supportive, they had more autonomous motivation for not smoking, and that, in turn, predicted a decrease in their self-reports of smoking.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Peer-to-peer interactions and support groups mitigate experiences of social isolation and loneliness often reported by individuals with psychotic disorders. Online peer-to-peer communication can promote broader use of this form of social support. Peer-to-peer interactions occur naturally on social media platforms, but they can negatively affect mental health. Recent digital interventions for persons with psychotic disorders have harnessed the principles of social media to incorporate peer-to-peer communication. This review examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of recent digital interventions in order to identify strategies to maximize benefits of online peer-to-peer communication for persons with psychotic disorders. METHODS: An electronic database search of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Health Technology Assessment Database was conducted in February 2017 and yielded a total of 1,015 results. Eight publications that reported data from six independent trials and five interventions were reviewed. RESULTS: The technology supporting peer-to-peer communication varied greatly across studies, from online forums to embedded social networking. When peer-to-peer interactions were moderated by facilitators, retention, engagement, acceptability, and efficacy were higher than for interventions with no facilitators. Individuals with psychotic disorders were actively engaged with moderated peer-to-peer communication and showed improvements in perceived social support. Studies involving service users in intervention design showed higher rates of acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with psychotic disorders value and benefit from digital interventions that include moderated peer-to-peer interactions. Incorporating peer-to-peer communication into digital interventions for this population may increase compliance with other evidence-based therapies by producing more acceptable and engaging online environments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a leading health threat. Determination of optimal therapies for long-term weight loss remains a challenge. Evidence suggests that successful weight loss depends on the compliance of weight loss program participants with their weight loss efforts. Despite this, little is known regarding the attributes influencing such compliance. The purpose of this study was to assess, using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), the relative importance of weight loss program attributes to its participants and to express these preferences in terms of their willingness to pay for them. RESEARCH METHODS: A DCE survey explored the following weight loss program attributes in a sample of 165 overweight adults enrolled in community weight loss programs: cost, travel time required to attend, extent of physician involvement (e.g., none, monthly, every 2 weeks), components (e.g., diet, exercise, behavior change) emphasized, and focus (e.g., group, individual). The rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes and the willingness to pay for different configurations of combined attributes were estimated using regression modeling. RESULTS: All attributes investigated appeared to be statistically significant. The most important unit change was "program components emphasized" (e.g., moving from diet only to diet and exercise). DISCUSSION: The majority of participants were willing to pay for weight loss programs that reflected their preferences. The DCE tool was useful in quantifying and understanding individual preferences in obesity management and provided information that could help to maximize the efficiency of existing weight loss programs or the design of new programs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Economic evidence relating to tobacco control is generally derived from the cost effectiveness of smoking-cessation programs or the economic impact of tobacco-induced disease, based on revealed-preference data. However, empirical estimates from stated-preference data on tobacco users' preferences, smoking behaviour and smoking cessation aids using analytical techniques such as discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) could be important for policy decision making in tobacco control. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to review the practice and utility of DCE methodology across nicotine- and tobacco-related issues, particularly smoking and smoking-cessation behaviour, anti-smoking policies and preferences for smoking-cessation aids. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, MEDLINE and ECONLIT databases for full-text original research articles on tobacco-related issues published between January 2000 and April 2016 that used a DCE method. We summarised the evidence and methodological characteristics of DCEs according to Lancsar and Louviere, 2008. RESULTS: Our review of the 12 eligible studies showed that DCE methodology was used to elicit smoker preferences and to evaluate tobacco-control policies. The majority of the studies were published in the last 5 years. The areas of application were smoking cessation, smoking behaviour, electronic cigarette use, water-pipe smoking and tobacco packaging. Monetary attributes were the most influential attributes in all studies. The design of the DCEs varied. CONCLUSION: DCE studies of tobacco-related issues were methodologically consistent with guidelines proposed for conducting health-related DCEs.},

	abstract = {Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical finding that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even though extant research has identified a variety of antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the findings of the individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding of when large assortments can benefit choice and when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N=7202) reported by prior research, we identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difficulty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and significant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difficulty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also find that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research—satisfaction/confidence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is significant—a finding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

	abstract = {Our objective is to provide a current perspective on the avoidable causes of global and US cancer incidence and mortality. Cancer registry–based incidence patterns, population behavioral risk-factor survey data, and systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies are the basis for estimates of relative risk, the prevalence of exposures to various lifestyle and environmental risk factors, and their impact expressed as population attributable fractions (PAFs). Of the total 59 million global deaths in 2008, 12–13\% were attributed to cancer. The increasing burden of cancers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is attributable in part to increasing urbanization, expansion of the adult population at risk, and increasing or persistent exposures to infectious agents, tobacco, and dietary deficiencies. Attributable fractions for lifestyle and environmental risk factors are summarized for the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Assuming minimal overlap in the distribution of risk factors in the population and discounting the potential for interaction in their combined effects, we estimate that a maximum of 60\% of cancer deaths in the United States may be attributed to eight risk factors: tobacco, alcohol, ionizing and solar radiations, occupations, infectious agents, obesity, and physical inactivity.},

In the current study, we extended this research to examine whether a persuasive appeal’s effectiveness can be increased by aligning the message framing with the recipient’s personality profile. For a single product, we constructed five advertisements, each designed to target one of the five major trait domains of human personality. In a sample of 324 survey respondents, advertisements were evaluated more positively the more they cohered with participants’ dispositional motives. These results suggest that adapting persuasive messages to the personality traits of the target audience can be an effective way of increasing the messages’ impact, and highlight the potential value of personality-based communication strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet is now an indispensable part of daily life for the majority of people in many parts of the world. It offers an additional means of effecting changes to behaviour such as smoking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register. There were no restrictions placed on language of publication or publication date. The most recent search was conducted in April 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials. Participants were people who smoked, with no exclusions based on age, gender, ethnicity, language or health status. Any type of Internet intervention was eligible. The comparison condition could be a no-intervention control, a different Internet intervention, or a non-Internet intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Methodological and study quality details were extracted using a standardized form. We extracted smoking cessation outcomes of six months follow-up or more, reporting short-term outcomes where longer-term outcomes were not available. We reported study effects as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95\% confidence interval (CI). Clinical and statistical heterogeneity limited our ability to pool studies. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review includes a total of 28 studies with over 45,000 participants. Some Internet programmes were intensive and included multiple outreach contacts with participants, whilst others relied on participants to initiate and maintain use.Fifteen trials compared an Internet intervention to a non-Internet-based smoking cessation intervention or to a no-intervention control. Ten of these recruited adults, one recruited young adult university students and two recruited adolescents. Seven of the trials in adults had follow-up at six months or longer and compared an Internet intervention to usual care or printed self help. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, pooled results from three trials that compared interactive and individually tailored interventions to usual care or written self help detected a statistically significant effect in favour of the intervention (RR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.11 to 2.78). However all three trials were judged to be at high risk of bias in one domain and high statistical heterogeneity was detected (I(2) = 53\%), with no obvious clinical explanation. Pooled results from two studies of an interactive, tailored intervention involving the Internet and automated phone contacts also detected a significant effect (RR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.42 to 2.97, I(2) = 42\%). Results from a sixth study comparing an interactive but non-tailored intervention to control did not detect a significant effect, nor did the seventh study, which compared a non-interactive, non-tailored intervention to control. Three trials comparing Internet interventions to face-to-face or phone counselling also did not detect evidence of an effect, nor did two trials evaluating Internet interventions as adjuncts to other behavioural interventions. A trial in college students increased point prevalence abstinence after 30 weeks but had no effect on sustained abstinence. Two small trials in adolescents did not detect an effect on cessation compared to control.Fourteen trials, all in adult populations, compared different Internet sites or programmes. Pooled estimates from three trials that compared tailored and/or interactive Internet programmes with non-tailored, non-interactive Internet programmes did not detect evidence of an effect (RR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.32, I(2) = 0\%). One trial detected evidence of a benefit from a tailored email compared to a non-tailored one, whereas a second trial comparing tailored messages to a non-tailored message did not detect evidence of an effect. Trials failed to detect a benefit of including a mood management component (three trials), or an asynchronous bulletin board. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that some Internet-based interventions can assist smoking cessation at six months or longer, particularly those which are interactive and tailored to individuals. However, the trials that compared Internet interventions with usual care or self help did not show consistent effects and were at risk of bias. Further research is needed despite 28 studies on the subject. Future studies should carefully consider optimising the interventions which promise most effect such as tailoring and interactivity.},

Preferences for information and decisional autonomy were measured by a translated version of autonomy preference index. Health attribution was measured by a scale modified from multi-dimensional health locus of control scales. After adjusting for socio-economic status, multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that information preference was positively associated with decisional preference among individuals who believed their health is less dependent on influential others. However, the reversed relationship was observed in case of individuals with attribution to others. The results suggested that individuals may use medical information for different purposes according to the types of health-related attribution beliefs.},

The doctrine of informed consent, which is an important ethical principle and legal requirement in medical practice, is being challenged by these insights into decision-making and real-world choice behaviour. This article discusses the implications of recent insights of research on decision-making behaviour for the informed consent doctrine. It concludes that there is a significant tension between the often non-rational choice behaviour and the traditional theory of informed consent. Responsible ways of dealing with or solving these problems are considered. To this end, patient decisions aids (PDAs) are discussed as suitable interventions to support autonomous decision-making. However, current PDAs demand certain improvements in order to protect and promote autonomous decision-making. Based on a conception of autonomy, we will argue which type of improvements are needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aims  Decision aids in practice may affect patient trust in the clinician, a requirement for optimal diabetes care. We sought to determine the impact of a decision aid to help patients with diabetes decide about statins (Statin Choice) on patients’ trust in the clinician. Methods  We randomized 16 diabetologists and 98 patients with type 2 diabetes referred to a subspecialty diabetes clinic to use the Statin Choice decision aid or a patient pamphlet about dyslipidaemia, and then to receive these materials from either the clinician during the visit or a researcher prior to the visit. Providers and patients were blinded to the study hypothesis. Immediately after the clinical encounter, patients completed a survey including questions on trust (range 0 to total trust = 100), knowledge, and decisional conflict. Researchers reviewed videotaped encounters and assessed patient participation (using the OPTION scale) and visit length. Results  Overall mean trust score was 91 (median 97.2, IQR 86, 100). After adjustment for patient characteristics, results suggested greater total trust (trust = 100) with the decision aid [odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95\% CI 0.94, 3.35]. Total trust was associated with knowledge (for each additional knowledge point, OR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.1, 1.6), patient participation (for each additional point in the OPTION scale, OR 1.1, 95\% CI 1.1, 1.2), and decisional conflict (for every 5‐point decrease in conflict, OR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.2, 1.9). Total trust was not associated with visit length, which the decision aid did not significantly affect. There was no significant effect interaction across the trial factors. Conclusions  Preliminary evidence suggests that decision aids do not have a large negative impact on trust in the physician and may increase trust through improvements in the decision‐making process.},

	abstract = {Objective To understand how well patients make value congruent decisions with and without patient decision aids (PtDAs) for screening and treatment options, and identify issues with its measurement and evaluation. Methods A sub-analysis of trials included in the 2014 Cochrane Review of Decision Aids. Eligible trials measured value congruence with chosen option. Two reviewers independently screened 115 trials. Results Among 18 included trials, 8 (44\%) measured value congruence using the Multidimensional Measure of Informed Choice (MMIC), 7 (39\%) used heterogeneous methods, and 3 (17\%) used unclear methods. Pooled results of trials that used heterogeneous measures were statistically non-significant (n=3). Results from trials that used the MMIC suggest patients are 48\% more likely to make value congruent decisions when exposed to a PtDA for a screening decision (RR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.16, n=8). Conclusion Patients struggle to make value congruent decisions, but PtDAs may help. While the absolute improvement is relatively small it may be underestimated due to sample size issues, definitions, and heterogeneity of measures. Practice Implications Current approaches are inadequate to support patients making decisions that are consistent with their values. There is some evidence that PtDAs support patients with achieving values congruent decisions for screening choices.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The IPDAS Collaboration has developed a checklist and an instrument (IPDASi v3.0) to assess the quality of patient decision aids (PDAs) in terms of their development process and shared decision-making design components. Certification of PDAs is of growing interest in the US and elsewhere. We report a modified Delphi consensus process to agree on IPDASi (v3.0) items that should be considered as minimum standards for PDA certification, for inclusion in the refined IPDASi (v4.0). METHODS: A 2-stage Delphi voting process considered the inclusion of IPDASi (v3.0) items as minimum standards. Item scores and qualitative comments were analyzed, followed by expert group discussion. RESULTS: One hundred and one people voted in round 1; 87 in round 2. Forty-seven items were reduced to 44 items across 3 new categories: 1) qualifying criteria, which are required in order for an intervention to be considered a decision aid (6 items); 2) certification criteria, without which a decision aid is judged to have a high risk of harmful bias (10 items); and 3) quality criteria, believed to strengthen a decision aid but whose omission does not present a high risk of harmful bias (28 items). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary certification criteria for PDAs. Scoring and rating processes need to be tested and finalized. However, the process of appraising the quality of the clinical evidence reported by the PDA should be used to complement these criteria; the proposed standards are designed to rate the quality of the development process and shared decision-making design elements, not the quality of the PDA's clinical content.},

Participants General practices Inclusion criteria: {\textgreater}4 medical partners; list size {\textgreater}7000; and a diabetes register with {\textgreater}1\% of practice population. 191 practices assessed for eligibility, and 49 practices randomised and completed the study. Patients People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) taking at least two oral glucose-lowering drugs with maximum tolerated dose with a glycosolated haemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than 7.4\% (IFCC HbA1c {\textgreater}57 mmol/mol) or advised in the preceeding 6 months to add or consider changing to insulin therapy. Exclusion criteria: currently using insulin therapy; difficulty reading or understanding English; difficulty in understanding the purpose of the study; visual or cognitive impairment or mentally ill. A total of 182 assessed for eligibility, 175 randomised to 95 intervention and 80 controls, and 167 completion and analysis. Intervention Brief training of clinicians and use of PDA with patients in single consultation. Primary outcomes Decision quality (Decisional Conflict Scores, knowledge, realistic expectations and autonomy) and glycaemic control (glycosolated haemoglobin, HbA1c). Secondary outcomes Knowledge and realistic expectations of the risks and benefits of insulin therapy and diabetic complications. Results Intervention group: lower total Decisional Conflict Scores (17.4 vs 25.2, p{\textless}0.001); better knowledge (51.6\% vs 28.8\%, p{\textless}0.001); realistic expectations (risk of ‘hypo’, ‘weight gain’, ‘complications’; 81.0\% vs 5.2\%, 70.5\% vs 5.3\%, 26.3\% vs 5.0\% respectively, p{\textless}0.001); and were more autonomous in decision-making (64.1\% vs 42.9\%, p=0.012). No significant difference in the glycaemic control between the two groups. Conclusions Use of the PANDAs decision aid reduces decisional conflict, improves knowledge, promotes realistic expectations and autonomy in people with diabetes making treatment choices in general practice.

As predicted, the probability of a threat's occurrence and the effectiveness of a coping response both had positive main effects on intentions to adopt a recommended preventive health behavior. More importantly, the findings provided support for self-efficacy expectancy as a fourth component of protection motivation theory: Self-efficacy had a direct influence on intentions and interacted with two other variables of protection motivation theory. The interaction effect was interpreted in terms of two new decision-making strategies that people use when confronted with a fear appeal: a precaution strategy and a hyperdefensiveness strategy. In addition, the results replicated previous findings on the relationship between self-efficacy expectancy and outcome expectancy.

The three studies provided a total of 41 mean estimates for the first three measures but only 28 mean estimates for the 6-month prolonged abstinence measure. The data demonstrate an extremely high relationship between all four measures. The first three measures (24-hour point prevalence, 7-day point prevalence, and 30-day prolonged abstinence) all correlated in excess of .98 with each other. The only measure that did not demonstrate the same degree of almost perfect equivalence was 6-month prolonged abstinence, but even here the lowest correlation with the other three measures was .82. For practical purposes, the first three measures will result in the same conclusions when used as outcome measures in smoking cessation studies.},

Biochemical assessments are primarily measures of point prevalence abstinence. The desirability of biochemical validation is a particularly controversial and critical issue. Three factors affect the accuracy of self-report: Type of Population, Type of Intervention, and Demand Characteristics. False-negative rates are generally low. Three broad issues impact on decisions to use biochemical validation: (a) alternative explanations for false positives, (b) refusal rate problems, and (c) the effect of inaccuracy on intervention assessment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Taking regular exercise may help people give up smoking by moderating nicotine withdrawal and cravings, and by helping to manage weight gain. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exercise-based interventions alone, or combined with a smoking cessation programme, are more effective than a smoking cessation intervention alone. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register in April 2014, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL Plus in May 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized trials which compared an exercise programme alone, or an exercise programme as an adjunct to a cessation programme, with a cessation programme (which we considered the control in this review). Studies were required to recruit smokers or recent quitters and have a follow-up of six months or more. Studies that did not meet the full inclusion criteria because they only assessed the acute effects of exercise on smoking behaviour, or because the outcome was smoking reduction, are summarised but not formally included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on study characteristics and smoking outcomes. Because of differences between studies in the characteristics of the interventions used we summarized the results narratively, making no attempt at meta-analysis. We assessed risk of selection and attrition bias using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 20 trials with a total of 5,870 participants. The largest study was an internet trial with 2,318 participants, and eight trials had fewer than 30 people in each treatment arm. Studies varied in the timing and intensity of the smoking cessation and exercise programmes offered. Only one included study was judged to be at low risk of bias across all domains assessed. Four studies showed significantly higher abstinence rates in a physically active group versus a control group at end of treatment. One of these studies also showed a significant benefit for exercise versus control on abstinence at the three-month follow-up and a benefit for exercise of borderline significance (p = 0.05) at the 12-month follow-up. Another study reported significantly higher abstinence rates at six month follow-up for a combined exercise and smoking cessation programme compared with brief smoking cessation advice. One study showed significantly higher abstinence rates for the exercise group versus a control group at the three-month follow-up but not at the end of treatment or 12-month follow-up. The other studies showed no significant effect for exercise on abstinence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only two of the 20 trials offered evidence for exercise aiding smoking cessation in the long term. All the other trials were too small to reliably exclude an effect of intervention, or included an exercise intervention which may not have been sufficiently intense to achieve the desired level of exercise. Trials are needed with larger sample sizes, sufficiently intense interventions in terms of both exercise intensity and intensity of support being provided, equal contact control conditions, and measures of exercise adherence and change in physical activity in both exercise and comparison groups.},

	abstract = {Objective: The urge to smoke is a predictor of smoking relapse. Little research has focused on the impact of acute urges during treatment among African Americans. This study examined the relationship between smoking urges and long-term abstinence among treatment seekers. Design: Longitudinal prospective investigation. Urges to smoke were assessed at the initial (session 1) and final (session 8) sessions among adult smokers (N=308) enrolled in a 4-week group intervention trial. Nicotine patch use was assessed over 30 days. Main Outcome Measures: Biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (7-day ppa) was assessed immediately post-intervention, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Hierarchical logistic regressions tested associations between session 1 and session 8 urges and 7-day ppa at each smoking status assessment. Results: There was a significant overall decrease in smoking urges (M=29, SD=15 at session 1; M=17, SD=11 at session 8). After controlling for covariates, urges to smoke at session 1 were unrelated to 7-day ppa at any of the assessment points. However, session 8 urges were inversely associated with 7-day ppa post-intervention (AOR=.94, CI:.92-.97), at 3-months (AOR=.93, CI: .89-.97), 6-months (AOR=.93, CI: .90-.97), and 12-months (AOR=.96, CI: .96-.99). Nicotine patch use was positively associated with 7-day ppa at each assessment. Conclusions: The most robust predictors of abstinence through 12-months post-intervention were decreased urges over the 4-week, 8-session group intervention and the frequency of nicotine patch use. Interventions aimed at addressing the needs of African American smokers should address urges and encourage nicotine replacement adherence to increase abstinence rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both behavioural support (including brief advice and counselling) and pharmacotherapies (including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline and bupropion) are effective in helping people to stop smoking. Combining both treatment approaches is recommended where possible, but the size of the treatment effect with different combinations and in different settings and populations is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medication to aid smoking cessation, compared to a minimal intervention or usual care, and to identify whether there are different effects depending on characteristics of the treatment setting, intervention, population treated, or take-up of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2015 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support for smoking cessation, compared to a control receiving usual care or brief advice or less intensive behavioural support. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by two authors. Data was extracted by one author and checked by another.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-three studies with a total of more than 25,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. A large proportion of studies recruited people in healthcare settings or with specific health needs. Most studies provided NRT. Behavioural support was typically provided by specialists in cessation counselling, who offered between four and eight contact sessions. The planned maximum duration of contact was typically more than 30 minutes but less than 300 minutes. Overall, studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, and findings were not sensitive to the exclusion of any of the six studies rated at high risk of bias in one domain. One large study (the Lung Health Study) contributed heterogeneity due to a substantially larger treatment effect than seen in other studies (RR 3.88, 95\% CI 3.35 to 4.50). Since this study used a particularly intensive intervention which included extended availability of nicotine gum, multiple group sessions and long term maintenance and recycling contacts, the results may not be comparable with the interventions used in other studies, and hence it was not pooled in other analyses. Based on the remaining 52 studies (19,488 participants) there was high quality evidence (using GRADE) for a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural treatment compared to usual care, brief advice or less intensive behavioural support (RR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.68 to 1.98) with moderate statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 36\%).The pooled estimate for 43 trials that recruited participants in healthcare settings (RR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.79 to 2.18) was higher than for eight trials with community-based recruitment (RR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.33 to 1.76). Compared to the first version of the review, previous weak evidence of differences in other subgroup analyses has disappeared. We did not detect differences between subgroups defined by motivation to quit, treatment provider, number or duration of support sessions, or take-up of treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural support increase smoking cessation success compared to a minimal intervention or usual care. Updating this review with an additional 12 studies (5,000 participants) did not materially change the effect estimate. Although trials differed in the details of their populations and interventions, we did not detect any factors that modified treatment effects apart from the recruitment setting. We did not find evidence from indirect comparisons that offering more intensive behavioural support was associated with larger treatment effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Group therapy offers individuals the opportunity to learn behavioural techniques for smoking cessation, and to provide each other with mutual support. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of group-delivered behavioural interventions in achieving long-term smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, using the terms 'behavior therapy', 'cognitive therapy', 'psychotherapy' or 'group therapy', in May 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials that compared group therapy with self-help, individual counselling, another intervention or no intervention (including usual care or a waiting-list control). We also considered trials that compared more than one group programme. We included those trials with a minimum of two group meetings, and follow-up of smoking status at least six months after the start of the programme. We excluded trials in which group therapy was provided to both active therapy and placebo arms of trials of pharmacotherapies, unless they had a factorial design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the interventions provided to the groups and the controls, including programme length, intensity and main components, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in participants smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically-validated rates where available. We analysed participants lost to follow-up as continuing smokers. We expressed effects as a risk ratio for cessation. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model. We assessed the quality of evidence within each study and comparison, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-six trials met our inclusion criteria for one or more of the comparisons in the review. Thirteen trials compared a group programme with a self-help programme; there was an increase in cessation with the use of a group programme (N = 4395, risk ratio (RR) 1.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.33, I2 = 0\%). We judged the GRADE quality of evidence to be moderate, downgraded due to there being few studies at low risk of bias. Fourteen trials compared a group programme with brief support from a health care provider. There was a small increase in cessation (N = 7286, RR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.43, I2 = 59\%). We judged the GRADE quality of evidence to be low, downgraded due to inconsistency in addition to risk of bias. There was also low quality evidence of benefit of a group programme compared to no-intervention controls, (9 trials, N = 1098, RR 2.60, 95\% CI 1.80 to 3.76 I2 = 55\%). We did not detect evidence that group therapy was more effective than a similar intensity of individual counselling (6 trials, N = 980, RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.76 to 1.28, I2 = 9\%). Programmes which included components for increasing cognitive and behavioural skills were not shown to be more effective than same-length or shorter programmes without these components. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Group therapy is better for helping people stop smoking than self-help, and other less intensive interventions. There is not enough evidence to evaluate whether groups are more effective, or cost-effective, than intensive individual counselling. There is not enough evidence to support the use of particular psychological components in a programme beyond the support and skills training normally included.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet has become a popular medium for offering tailored and targeted health promotion programs to the general public. However, suboptimal levels of program use in the target population limit the public health impact of these programs. Optimizing program development is considered as one of the main processes to increase usage rates. OBJECTIVE: To distinguish factors potentially related to optimal development of health-related websites by involving both experts and potential users. By considering and incorporating the opinions of experts and potential users in the development process, involvement in the program is expected to increase, consequently resulting in increased appreciation, lower levels of attrition, and higher levels of sustained use. METHODS: We conducted a systematic three-round Delphi study through the Internet. Both national and international experts (from the fields of health promotion, health psychology, e-communication, and technical Web design) and potential users were invited via email to participate. During this study an extensive list of factors potentially related to optimal development of health-related websites was identified, by focusing on factors related to layout, general and risk information provision, questionnaire use, additional services, and ease of use. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which experts and potential users agreed on the importance of these factors. Differences as well as similarities among experts and potentials users were deduced. RESULTS: In total, 20 of 62 contacted experts participated in the first round (32\% response rate); 60 of 200 contacted experts (30\% response rate) and 210 potential users (95\% response rate) completed the second-round questionnaire, and 32 of 60 contacted experts completed the third round (53\% response rate). Results revealed important factors consented upon by experts and potential users (eg, ease of use, clear structure, and detailed health information provision), as well as differences regarding important factors consented upon by experts (eg, visual aids, self-monitoring tool, and iterative health feedback) or by potential users only (eg, bread crumb navigation and prevention of receiving spam). CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important first step in determining the agreed-upon factors that should be taken into account when developing online health promotion programs. The public health impact of these programs will be improved by optimizing the development process in line with these factors.},

Yet little attention has been paid to the large majority of ex-smokers who quit without recourse to any formal assistance. To many, these unassisted quitters are of little interest other than as a comparator population against which to test the efficacy or effectiveness of pharmaceutical or behavioral interventions. The effect of this neglect is compounded by the preference for reporting intervention success as rates rather than as the numbers of ex-smokers generated across populations through such interventions. In so doing, researchers have insulated those in policy and practice from the importance of unassisted smoking cessation and the unparalleled contribution it has made and will continue to make to reducing smoking prevalence.},

	abstract = {Objective To explore the quitting histories of Australian ex-smokers in order to develop an understanding of the varied contribution of smoking cessation assistance (either pharmacotherapy or professionally mediated behavioural support) to the process of quitting.Design Qualitative grounded theory study; in-depth interviews.Participants 37 Australian adult ex-smokers (24–68 years; 15 men, 22 women) who quit in the past 6–24 months.Results Although participants’ individual quitting histories and their overall experiences of quitting were unique, when the 37 quitting histories were compared it was clear two experiences were common to almost all participants: almost no one quit at their first quit attempt and almost everyone started out quitting unassisted. Furthermore, distinct patterns existed in the timing and use of assistance, in particular the age at which assistance was first used, how some participants were resolutely uninterested in assistance, and how assistance might have contributed to the process of successful quitting even if not used on the final quit attempt. Importantly, three patterns in use of assistance were identified: (1) only ever tried to quit unassisted (n=13); (2) started unassisted, tried assistance but reverted back to unassisted (n=13); (3) started unassisted, tried assistance and quit with assistance (n=11). For most participants, insight into what quitting would require was only gained through prior quitting experiences with and without assistance. For a number of participants, interest in assistance was at its lowest when the participant was most ready to quit.Conclusion Quitting should be viewed as a process drawing on elements of assisted and unassisted quitting rather than a stand-alone event that can be labelled as strictly assisted or unassisted.\%U http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/early/2017/11/23/tobaccocontrol-2017-053919.full.pdf},

	abstract = {Objective When tobacco smokers quit, between half and two-thirds quit unassisted: that is, they do not consult their general practitioner (GP), use pharmacotherapy (nicotine-replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline), or phone a quitline. We sought to understand why smokers quit unassisted.Design Qualitative grounded theory study (in-depth interviews, theoretical sampling, concurrent data collection and data analysis).Participants 21 Australian adult ex-smokers (aged 28–68 years; 9 males and 12 females) who quit unassisted within the past 6 months to 2 years. 12 participants had previous experience of using assistance to quit; 9 had never previously used assistance.Setting Community, Australia.Results Along with previously identified barriers to use of cessation assistance (cost, access, lack of awareness or knowledge of assistance, including misperceptions about effectiveness or safety), our study produced new explanations of why smokers quit unassisted: (1) they prioritise lay knowledge gained directly from personal experiences and indirectly from others over professional or theoretical knowledge; (2) their evaluation of the costs and benefits of quitting unassisted versus those of using assistance favours quitting unassisted; (3) they believe quitting is their personal responsibility; and (4) they perceive quitting unassisted to be the ‘right’ or ‘better’ choice in terms of how this relates to their own self-identity or self-image. Deep-rooted personal and societal values such as independence, strength, autonomy and self-control appear to be influencing smokers’ beliefs and decisions about quitting.Conclusions The reasons for smokers’ rejection of the conventional medical model for smoking cessation are complex and go beyond modifiable or correctable problems relating to misperceptions or treatment barriers. These findings suggest that GPs could recognise and respect smokers’ reasons for rejecting assistance, validate and approve their choices, and modify brief interventions to support their preference for quitting unassisted, where preferred. Further research and translation may assist in developing such strategies for use in practice.\%U http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/5/4/e007301.full.pdf},

Participants were 225 pregnant women in two general hospitals in the UK, women receiving low-risk results following serum screening for Down syndrome. The MMIC was administered before testing and the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale was administered 6 weeks later. The component scales of the MMIC, knowledge and attitude, were internally consistent (alpha values of 0.68 and 0.78, respectively). Those who made a choice categorised as informed using the MMIC rated their decision 6 weeks later as being more informed, better supported and of higher quality than women whose choice was categorised as uninformed. This provides evidence of predictive validity, whilst the lack of association between the MMIC and anxiety shows construct (discriminant) validity. Thus, the MMIC has been shown to be psychometrically robust in pregnant women offered the choice to undergo prenatal screening for Down syndrome and receiving a low-risk result. Replication of this finding in other groups, facing other decisions, with other outcomes, should be assessed in future research.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA for aneuploidy is a highly accurate screening test; however, concerns exist around the potential for routinisation of testing. The multidimensional measure of informed choice (MMIC) is a quantitative instrument developed to assess informed choice for Down syndrome screening (DSS). We have validated a modified MMIC for NIPT and measured informed choice among women offered NIPT in a public health service. The measure was distributed to women recruited across eight maternity units in the United Kingdom who had accepted DSS. Construct validity was assessed by simultaneously conducting qualitative interviews. Five hundred and eighty-five questionnaires were completed and 45 interviews conducted after blood-draw (or equivalent for those that declined NIPT). The measure demonstrated good internal consistency and internal validity. Results indicate the vast majority of women (89\%) made an informed choice; 95\% were judged to have good knowledge, 88\% had a positive attitude and 92\% had deliberated. Of the 11\% judged to have made an uninformed choice, 55\% had not deliberated, 41\% had insufficient knowledge, and 19\% had a negative attitude. Ethnicity (OR=2.78, P=0.003) and accepting NIPT (OR=16.05, P=0.021) were found to be significant predictors of informed choice. The high rate of informed choice is likely to reflect the importance placed on the provision of pre-test counselling in this study. It will be vital to ensure that this is maintained once NIPT is offered in routine clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) is used for assessing nicotine dependence. A shorter test derived from the FTND used for the general population is the Heavy Smoking Index (HSI) (six questions vs. two). The objective of this study is to compare the validity of the HSI versus the FTND. METHODS: A survey of tobacco use in the general population was carried out in the northern Spanish region of Galicia using both the FTND and the HSI to study a representative sample of 1655 daily smokers. The HSI was compared with the FTND, considered the gold standard. Measures of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated. Concordance between the tests was also established (Cohen's kappa). RESULTS: Cohen's kappa showed good agreement between measures (Kappa = 0.7); specificity values were also high (Sp = 96.2\%). Sensitivity analysis in females (Se = 62.3\%) did not show good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The HSI can be used as a reasonably good screening test in order to identify daily smokers with high nicotine dependence. Nevertheless, for populations or subpopulations having low nicotine dependence, such as women, the FTND is more reliable.},

	abstract = {Introduction Smartphone-based smoking cessation interventions are increasingly used around the world. However, the effects of smartphone applications on applicability and efficacy on cessation rate and prevention of relapses are not often evaluated. Therefore, this review aims to assess the evidence on effectiveness of smartphone applications as an intervention tool for smoking cessation support. Material and Methods We conducted the search using Ovid Medline/PubMed, CENTRAL and Scopus databases dated (January 2007- June 2016). Inclusion criteria include randomized control trials or intervention studies with mobile applications that offer smoking cessation support. Two assessors independently extracted and evaluated the data from each included study Results The review of eight selected studies illustrate the use of smartphone applications in increasing quit rates among smokers, however adherence to app features influences quit rates. Audiovisual features followed by a quit plan, tracking progress and sharing features are most accepted and utilised app features. However, inconsistency was observed in their association with abstinence or quit rate. App engagement features increase the statistical significance in the quit rate. Development of smartphone applications was supported by behaviour change theories in all studies nevertheless; heterogeneous forms of intervention were adopted within studies. Similarly, reduction in relapse attributed to enhanced discussion among quitters using social media applications was observed. Conclusions Quality evidence is warranted with large sample size to measure effect size of the intervention. Future research on effectiveness and efficacy of smartphone alone and comparisons with other mHealth interventions, such as text messaging would be useful.},

Participants were 12.7 years of age on average at cohort inception and 24.0 years of age in cycle 22. Independent predictors of smoking initiation in young adulthood (post–high school) were identified in multivariable logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations. Results Of 1,293 participants, 75\% initiated smoking by cycle 22. Of these, 44\%, 43\%, and 14\% initiated before high school, during high school, and in the 6 years after high school, respectively. The incidence density rate of initiation was .33, .13, .14, .11, and .12 initiation events per person-year in grade 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively, and .05 post–high school. Independent predictors of smoking initiation in young adults included alcohol use, higher impulsivity, and poor academic performance. Conclusions A total of 14\% of smokers who initiated smoking before age 24 years did so after high school.

In this systematic review, our objectives were: 1) to determine whether social media interventions for smoking cessation are feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective; 2) to identify approaches for recruiting subjects; and 3) to examine the specific intervention design components and strategies employed to promote user engagement and retention. Methods We searched Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science through July 2016 and reference lists of relevant articles. Included studies described social media interventions for smoking cessation and must have reported outcomes related to feasibility, acceptability, usability, or smoking-related outcomes. Results We identified 7 studies (all were published since 2014) that enrolled 9755 participants (median=136 [range 40 to 9042]). Studies mainly used Facebook (n=4) or Twitter (n=2), and emerged as feasible and acceptable. Five studies reported smoking-related outcomes such as greater abstinence, reduction in relapse, and an increase in quit attempts. Most studies (n=6) recruited participants using online or Facebook advertisements. Tailored content, targeted reminders, and moderated discussions were used to promote participant engagement. Three studies found that active participation through posting comments or liking content may be associated with improved outcomes. Retention ranged from 35\% to 84\% (median=70\%) across the included studies. Conclusions Our review highlights the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of social media interventions for smoking cessation. Future research should continue to explore approaches for promoting user engagement and retention, and whether sustained engagement translates to clinically meaningful smoking cessation outcomes.},

This paper examines differences in how income is collected in a nationally representative UK birth cohort, the Millennium Cohort Study, looking at variations by questions asked and by respondent characteristics before then examining the implications different methods of collecting and reporting income may have for measuring poverty. Results show that less than a third of respondents give consistent information on income between measurement tools. Using multiple questions is associated with a substantially lower response rate but this method generally results in a higher estimate of family income than using a single question. This is particularly true for certain groups of the population\&\#x2014;those on means tested benefits, in self-employment and in part-time employment. Not surprisingly then in our analysis of poverty, using a single question produces an inflated proportion of families who could be classified as living in poverty and is less associated with other measures of financial deprivation than the more conservative poverty measure based on multiple questions.},

	abstract = {Background: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are electronic devices that heat a liquid - usually comprising propylene glycol and glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir - into an aerosol for inhalation. Since ECs appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady growth in sales. Smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of smoking, but some healthcare organisations have been reluctant to encourage smokers to switch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to know if these devices can reduce the harms associated with smoking. In particular, healthcare providers have an urgent need to know what advice they should give to smokers enquiring about ECs. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of ECs in helping people who smoke to achieve long-term abstinence; to examine the efficacy of ECs in helping people reduce cigarette consumption by at least 50\% of baseline levels; and to assess the occurrence of adverse events associated with EC use. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Groups Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases for relevant records from 2004 to July 2014, together with reference checking and contact with study authors. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which current smokers (motivated or unmotivated to quit) were randomized to EC or a control condition, and which measured abstinence rates or changes in cigarette consumption at six months or longer. As the field of EC research is new, we also included cohort follow-up studies with at least six months follow-up. We included randomized cross-over trials and cohort follow-up studies that included at least one week of EC use for assessment of adverse events. Data collection and analysis: One review author extracted data from the included studies and another checked them. Our main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, and we used the most rigorous definition available (continuous, biochemically validated, longest follow-up). For reduction we used a dichotomous approach (no change/reduction {\textless} 50\% versus reduction by 50\% or more of baseline cigarette consumption). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each study, and where appropriate we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses. Main results: Our search identified almost 600 records, from which we include 29 representing 13 completed studies (two RCTs, 11 cohort). We identified nine ongoing trials. Two RCTs compared EC with placebo (non-nicotine) EC, with a combined sample size of 662 participants. One trial included minimal telephone support and one recruited smokers not intending to quit, and both used early EC models with low nicotine content. We judged the RCTs to be at low risk of bias, but under the GRADE system the overall quality of the evidence for our outcomes was rated ‘low’ or ‘very low’ because of imprecision due to the small number of trials. A ‘low’ grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A ‘very low’ grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. Participants using an EC were more likely to have abstained from smoking for at least six months compared with participants using placebo EC (RR 2.29, 95\% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4\% versus EC 9\%; 2 studies; GRADE: low). The one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in six-month abstinence rates, but the confidence intervals do not rule out a clinically important difference (RR 1.26, 95\% CI: 0.68 to 2.34; GRADE: very low). A higher number of people were able to reduce cigarette consumption by at least half with ECs compared with placebo ECs (RR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.68, 2 studies; placebo: 27\% versus EC: 36\%; GRADE: low) and compared with patch (RR 1.41, 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.67, 1 study; patch: 44\% versus EC: 61\%; GRADE: very low). Unlike smoking cessation outcomes, reduction results were not biochemically verified. None of the RCTs or cohort studies reported any serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered to be plausibly related to EC use. One RCT provided data on the proportion of participants experiencing any adverse events. Although the proportion of participants in the study arms experiencing adverse events was similar, the confidence intervals are wide (ECs vs placebo EC RR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.71 to 1.34; ECs vs patch RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.81 to 1.22). The other RCT reported no statistically significant difference in the frequency of AEs at three- or 12-month follow-up between the EC and placebo EC groups, and showed that in all groups the frequency of AEs (with the exception of throat irritation) decreased significantly over time. Authors' conclusions: There is evidence from two trials that ECs help smokers to stop smoking long-term compared with placebo ECs. However, the small number of trials, low event rates and wide confidence intervals around the estimates mean that our confidence in the result is rated 'low' by GRADE standards. The lack of difference between the effect of ECs compared with nicotine patches found in one trial is uncertain for similar reasons. ECs appear to help smokers unable to stop smoking altogether to reduce their cigarette consumption when compared with placebo ECs and nicotine patches, but the above limitations also affect certainty in this finding. In addition, lack of biochemical assessment of the actual reduction in smoke intake further limits this evidence. No evidence emerged that short-term EC use is associated with health risk.},

This manuscript summarizes the evidence of TMs for smoking cessation, and makes recommendations for conceptual and methodological refinements to improve the next generation of related research. TM studies were identified for the following event categories: office visits, notification of abnormal test results, pregnancy, hospitalization and disease diagnosis. Cessation rates associated with pregnancy, hospitalization and disease diagnosis were high (10–60 and 15–78\%, respectively), whereas rates for clinic visits and abnormal test results were consistently lower (2–10 and 7–21\%, respectively). Drawing from accepted conceptual models, a TM heuristic is outlined that suggests three domains underlie whether a cueing event is significant enough to be a TM for smoking cessation: the extent to which the event (1) increases perceptions of personal risk and outcome expectancies, (2) prompts strong affective or emotional responses, and (3) redefines self-concept or social role. Research in TMs could be improved by giving greater attention to assessment of conceptually grounded cognitive and emotional variables, appropriately timed assessment and intervention, and inclusion of appropriate target and comparison samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a directive patient-centred style of counselling, designed to help people to explore and resolve ambivalence about behaviour change. It was developed as a treatment for alcohol abuse, but may help people to a make a successful attempt to quit smoking. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not motivational interviewing (MI) promotes smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for studies using the term motivat* NEAR2 (interview* OR enhanc* OR session* OR counsel* OR practi* OR behav*) in the title or abstract, or motivation* as a keyword. Date of the most recent search: August 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials in which motivational interviewing or its variants were offered to tobacco users to assist cessation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. We counted participants lost to follow-up as continuing smoking or relapsed. We performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 28 studies published between 1997 and 2014, involving over 16,000 participants. MI was conducted in one to six sessions, with the duration of each session ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. Interventions were delivered by primary care physicians, hospital clinicians, nurses or counsellors. Our meta-analysis of MI versus brief advice or usual care yielded a modest but significant increase in quitting (risk ratio (RR) 1.26; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.16 to 1.36; 28 studies; N = 16,803). Subgroup analyses found that MI delivered by primary care physicians resulted in an RR of 3.49 (95\% CI 1.53 to 7.94; 2 trials; N = 736). When delivered by counsellors the RR was smaller (1.25; 95\% CI 1.15 to 1.63; 22 trials; N = 13,593) but MI still resulted in higher quit rates than brief advice or usual care. When we compared MI interventions conducted through shorter sessions (less than 20 minutes per session) to controls, this resulted in an RR of 1.69 (95\% CI 1.34 to 2.12; 9 trials; N = 3651). Single-session treatments might increase the likelihood of quitting over multiple sessions, but both regimens produced positive outcomes. Evidence is unclear at present on the optimal number of follow-up calls.There was variation across the trials in treatment fidelity. All trials used some variant of motivational interviewing. Critical details in how it was modified for the particular study population, the training of therapists and the content of the counselling were sometimes lacking from trial reports. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interviewing may assist people to quit smoking. However, the results should be interpreted with caution, due to variations in study quality, treatment fidelity, between-study heterogeneity and the possibility of publication or selective reporting bias.},

This study aims to identify the level of consensus among and compare the opinions of two groups of experts (researchers and coaches who provide smoking cessation courses) regarding factors already studied in relation to smoking relapse, factors that have not yet been addressed and ideas on how to improve prevention programmes. A three-round Delphi method was employed. In the first round, 15 researchers completed an electronic questionnaire on factors associated with relapse. The results were used to develop a structured questionnaire for the second round, which was completed by 47 researchers and 61 coaches. The second-round results were then presented to the same experts in the third round, enabling them to re-rate their answers. Results revealed high consensus on some factors already identified as predicting relapse (e.g. self-efficacy), new factors (e.g. action planning) and several methods to improve prevention programmes. Generally speaking, the researchers and coaches provided similar suggestions. The results paint a picture of the current state of knowledge on relapse-related factors and point the way to areas for further research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Noncigarette tobacco products are increasingly popular. Researchers need to understand multiple tobacco product use to assess the effects of these products on population health. We estimate national prevalence and examine risk factors for multiple product use. METHOD: We calculated prevalence estimates of current use patterns involving cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes, hookah, smokeless tobacco, and snus using data from the 2012 RTI National Adult Tobacco Survey (N=3627), a random-digit-dial telephone survey of adults aged 18 and over. Associations between use patterns (exclusive single product and multiple products) and demographic characteristics were examined using Pearson chi-square tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: 32.1\% of adults currently use 1 or more tobacco products; 14.9\% use cigarettes exclusively, and 6.6\% use one noncigarette product exclusively, 6.9\% use cigarettes with another product (dual use), 1.3\% use two noncigarette products, and 2.4\% use three or more products (polytobacco use). Smokers who are young adult, male, never married, reside in the West, and made prior quit attempts were at risk for multiple product use. CONCLUSIONS: Over 10\% of U.S. adults use multiple tobacco products. A better understanding of multiple product use involving combustible products, like cigars and hookah, is needed. Multiple product use may be associated with past quit attempts.},

	abstract = {A workgroup formed by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco reviewed the literature on abstinence measures used in trials of smoking cessation interventions. We recommend that trials report multiple measures of abstinence. However, at a minimum we recommend that trial: (a) report prolonged abstinence (i.e., sustained abstinence after an initial period in which smoking is not counted as a failure) as the preferred measure, plus point prevalence as a secondary measure; (b) use 7 consecutive days of smoking or smoking on {\textgreater} or = 1 day of 2 consecutive weeks to define treatment failure; (c) include non-cigarette tobacco use, but not nicotine medications in definitions of failure; and (d) report results from survival analysis to describe outcomes more fully. Trials of smokers willing to set a quit date should tie all follow-ups to the quit date and report 6- and/or 12-month abstinence rates. For these trials, we recommend an initial 2-week grace period for prolonged abstinence definitions; however, the period may vary, depending on the presumed mechanism of the treatment. Trials of smokers who may not be currently trying to quit should tie follow-up to the initiation of the intervention and should report a prolonged abstinence measure of {\textgreater} or = 6-month duration and point prevalence rates at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The grace period for these trials will depend on the time necessary for treatment dissemination, which will vary depending on the treatment, setting, and population. Trials that use short-term follow-ups ({\textless} or = 3 months) to demonstrate possible efficacy should report a prolonged abstinence measure of {\textgreater} or = 4 weeks.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are at least three reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episode and antidepressants may relieve these. Secondly, nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepressants may substitute for this effect. Finally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways (e.g. inhibiting monoamine oxidase) or receptors (e.g. blockade of nicotinic-cholinergic receptors) underlying nicotine addiction. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to assess the effect and safety of antidepressant medications to aid long-term smoking cessation. The medications include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; lazabemide; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe); selegiline; sertraline; St. John's wort; tryptophan; venlafaxine; and zimeledine. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in July 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant medications to placebo or an alternative pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re-initiate smoking cessation or to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded trials with less than six months follow-up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as a risk ratio (RR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four new trials were identified since the 2009 update, bringing the total number of included trials to 90. There were 65 trials of bupropion and ten trials of nortriptyline, with the majority at low or unclear risk of bias. There was high quality evidence that, when used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion significantly increased long-term cessation (44 trials, N = 13,728, risk ratio [RR] 1.62, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.49 to 1.76). There was moderate quality evidence, limited by a relatively small number of trials and participants, that nortriptyline also significantly increased long-term cessation when used as the sole pharmacotherapy (six trials, N = 975, RR 2.03, 95\% CI 1.48 to 2.78). There is insufficient evidence that adding bupropion (12 trials, N = 3487, RR 1.9, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.51) or nortriptyline (4 trials, N = 1644, RR 1.21, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.55) to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provides an additional long-term benefit. Based on a limited amount of data from direct comparisons, bupropion and nortriptyline appear to be equally effective and of similar efficacy to NRT (bupropion versus nortriptyline 3 trials, N = 417, RR 1.30, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.82; bupropion versus NRT 8 trials, N = 4096, RR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.09; no direct comparisons between nortriptyline and NRT). Pooled results from four trials comparing bupropion to varenicline showed significantly lower quitting with bupropion than with varenicline (N = 1810, RR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.56 to 0.83). Meta-analyses did not detect a significant increase in the rate of serious adverse events amongst participants taking bupropion, though the confidence interval only narrowly missed statistical significance (33 trials, N = 9631, RR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.69). There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Bupropion has been associated with suicide risk, but whether this is causal is unclear. Nortriptyline has the potential for serious side-effects, but none have been seen in the few small trials for smoking cessation.There was no evidence of a significant effect for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on their own (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.71 to 1.22, N = 1594; 2 trials fluoxetine, 1 paroxetine, 1 sertraline) or as an adjunct to NRT (3 trials of fluoxetine, N = 466, RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.82). Significant effects were also not detected for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (RR 1.29, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.79, N = 827; 1 trial moclobemide, 5 selegiline), the atypical antidepressant venlafaxine (1 trial, N = 147, RR 1.22, 95\% CI 0.64 to 2.32), the herbal therapy St John's wort (hypericum) (2 trials, N = 261, RR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.26 to 2.53), or the dietary supplement SAMe (1 trial, N = 120, RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.24 to 2.07). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long-term smoking cessation. Adverse events with either medication appear to rarely be serious or lead to stopping medication. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement. Evidence also suggests that bupropion is less effective than varenicline, but further research is needed to confirm this finding. Evidence suggests that neither selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) nor monoamine oxidase inhibitors aid cessation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many smokers give up smoking on their own, but materials giving advice and information may help them and increase the number who quit successfully. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to determine: the effectiveness of different forms of print-based self-help materials, compared with no treatment and with other minimal contact strategies; the effectiveness of adjuncts to print-based self help, such as computer-generated feedback, telephone hotlines and pharmacotherapy; and the effectiveness of approaches tailored to the individual compared with non-tailored materials. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. Date of the most recent search April 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized trials of smoking cessation with follow-up of at least six months, where at least one arm tested a print-based self-help intervention. We defined self help as structured programming for smokers trying to quit without intensive contact with a therapist. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the nature of the self-help materials, the amount of face-to-face contact given to intervention and to control conditions, outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in people smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates when available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 74 trials which met the inclusion criteria. Many study reports did not include sufficient detail to judge risk of bias for some domains. Twenty-eight studies (38\%) were judged at high risk of bias for one or more domains but the overall risk of bias across all included studies was judged to be moderate, and unlikely to alter the conclusions.Thirty-four trials evaluated the effect of standard, non-tailored self-help materials. Pooling 11 of these trials in which there was no face-to-face contact and provision of structured self-help materials was compared to no intervention gave an estimate of benefit that just reached statistical significance (n = 13,241, risk ratio [RR] 1.19, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.37). This analysis excluded two trials with strongly positive outcomes that introduced significant heterogeneity. Six further trials without face-to-face contact in which the control group received alternative written materials did not show evidence for an effect of the smoking self-help materials (n = 7023, RR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.04). When these two subgroups were pooled, there was no longer evidence for a benefit of standard structured materials (n = 20,264, RR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.18). We failed to find evidence of benefit from providing standard self-help materials when there was brief contact with all participants (5 trials, n = 3866, RR 1.17, 95\% CI 0.96 to 1.42), or face-to-face advice for all participants (11 trials, n = 5365, RR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.18).Thirty-one trials offered materials tailored for the characteristics of individual smokers, with controls receiving either no materials, or stage matched or non-tailored materials. Most of the trials used more than one mailing. Pooling these showed a benefit of tailored materials (n = 40,890, RR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.37) with moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 32\%). The evidence is strongest for the subgroup of nine trials in which tailored materials were compared to no intervention (n = 13,437, RR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.53), but also supports tailored materials as more helpful than standard materials. Part of this effect could be due to the additional contact or assessment required to obtain individual data, since the subgroup of 10 trials where the number of contacts was matched did not detect an effect (n = 11,024, RR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.20). In two trials including a direct comparison between tailored materials and brief advice from a health care provider, there was no evidence of a difference, but confidence intervals were wide (n = 2992, RR 1.13, 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.49).Only four studies evaluated self-help materials as an adjunct to nicotine replacement therapy, with no evidence of additional benefit (n = 2291, RR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.88 to 1.25). A small number of other trials failed to detect benefits from using additional materials or targeted materials, or to find differences between different self-help programmes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Standard, print-based self-help materials increase quit rates compared to no intervention, but the effect is likely to be small. We did not find evidence that they have an additional benefit when used alongside other interventions such as advice from a healthcare professional, or nicotine replacement therapy. There is evidence that materials that are tailored for individual smokers are more effective than non-tailored materials, although the absolute size of effect is still small. Available evidence tested self-help interventions in high income countries; further research is needed to investigate their effect in contexts where more intensive support is not available.},

	abstract = {Background: In spite of gradual increases in tobacco price and the introduction of laws supporting various anti-tobacco measures, the proportion of smokers in Japan’s population is still higher than in other developed nations. Objective: To understand what information and individual characteristics drive smokers to attempt to quit smoking. These determinants will help to realise effective tobacco control policy as a base for understanding of cessation behaviour. Method: Discrete choice experiments on a total of 616 respondents registered at a consumer monitoring investigative company. Results: The effect of price is greater on smokers with lower nicotine dependence. For smokers of moderate and low dependency, short term health risks and health risks caused by passive smoking have a strong impact, though the existence of penalties and long term health risks have little influence on smokers’ decisions to quit. For highly dependent smokers, non-price attributes have little impact. Furthermore, the effects of age, sex and knowledge are also not uniform in accounting for smoking cessation. Conclusion: Determinants of smoking cessation vary among levels of nicotine dependency. Therefore, how and what information is provided needs to be carefully considered when counselling smokers to help them to quit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acupuncture and related techniques are promoted as a treatment for smoking cessation in the belief that they may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture and the related interventions of acupressure, laser therapy and electrostimulation in smoking cessation, in comparison with no intervention, sham treatment, or other interventions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register (which includes trials of smoking cessation interventions identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) and AMED in October 2013. We also searched four Chinese databases in September 2013: Sino-Med, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and VIP. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials comparing a form of acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electrostimulation with either no intervention, sham treatment or another intervention for smoking cessation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of smokers recruited, the nature of the intervention and control procedures, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up.We assessed abstinence from smoking at the earliest time-point (before six weeks) and at the last measurement point between six months and one year. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Those lost to follow-up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis pooling risk ratios using a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We included 38 studies. Based on three studies, acupuncture was not shown to be more effective than a waiting list control for long-term abstinence, with wide confidence intervals and evidence of heterogeneity (n = 393, risk ratio [RR] 1.79, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 3.28, I(2) = 57\%). Compared with sham acupuncture, the RR for the short-term effect of acupuncture was 1.22 (95\% CI 1.08 to 1.38), and for the long-term effect was 1.10 (95\% CI 0.86 to 1.40). The studies were not judged to be free from bias, and there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry with larger studies showing smaller effects. The heterogeneity between studies was not explained by the technique used. Acupuncture was less effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). There was no evidence that acupuncture is superior to psychological interventions in the short- or long-term. There is limited evidence that acupressure is superior to sham acupressure for short-term outcomes (3 trials, n = 325, RR 2.54, 95\% CI 1.27 to 5.08), but no trials reported long-term effects, The pooled estimate for studies testing an intervention that included continuous auricular stimulation suggested a short-term benefit compared to sham stimulation (14 trials, n = 1155, RR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.32 to 2.16); subgroup analysis showed an effect for continuous acupressure (7 studies, n = 496, RR 2.73, 95\% CI 1.78 to 4.18) but not acupuncture with indwelling needles (6 studies, n = 659, RR 1.24, 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.69). At longer follow-up the CIs did not exclude no effect (5 trials, n = 570, RR 1.47, 95\% CI 0.79 to 2.74). The evidence from two trials using laser stimulation was inconsistent and could not be combined. The combined evidence on electrostimulation suggests it is not superior to sham electrostimulation (short-term abstinence: 6 trials, n = 634, RR 1.13, 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.46; long-term abstinence: 2 trials, n = 405, RR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.61 to 1.23). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although pooled estimates suggest possible short-term effects there is no consistent, bias-free evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, or laser therapy have a sustained benefit on smoking cessation for six months or more. However, lack of evidence and methodological problems mean that no firm conclusions can be drawn. Electrostimulation is not effective for smoking cessation. Well-designed research into acupuncture, acupressure and laser stimulation is justified since these are popular interventions and safe when correctly applied, though these interventions alone are likely to be less effective than evidence-based interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individual counselling from a smoking cessation specialist may help smokers to make a successful attempt to stop smoking. OBJECTIVES: The review addresses the following hypotheses:1. Individual counselling is more effective than no treatment or brief advice in promoting smoking cessation.2. Individual counselling is more effective than self-help materials in promoting smoking cessation.3. A more intensive counselling intervention is more effective than a less intensive intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for studies with counsel* in any field in May 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized trials with at least one treatment arm consisting of face-to-face individual counselling from a healthcare worker not involved in routine clinical care. The outcome was smoking cessation at follow-up at least six months after the start of counselling. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors extracted data in duplicate. We recorded characteristics of the intervention and the target population, method of randomization and completeness of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically-validated rates where available. In analysis, we assumed that participants lost to follow-up continued to smoke. We expressed effects as a risk ratio (RR) for cessation. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model. We assessed the quality of evidence within each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 49 trials with around 19,000 participants. Thirty-three trials compared individual counselling to a minimal behavioural intervention. There was high-quality evidence that individual counselling was more effective than a minimal contact control (brief advice, usual care, or provision of self-help materials) when pharmacotherapy was not offered to any participants (RR 1.57, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 1.77; 27 studies, 11,100 participants; I2 = 50\%). There was moderate-quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) of a benefit of counselling when all participants received pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy) (RR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.51; 6 studies, 2662 participants; I2 = 0\%). There was moderate-quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) for a small benefit of more intensive counselling compared to brief counselling (RR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.53; 11 studies, 2920 participants; I2 = 48\%). None of the five other trials that compared different counselling models of similar intensity detected significant differences. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is high-quality evidence that individually-delivered smoking cessation counselling can assist smokers to quit. There is moderate-quality evidence of a smaller relative benefit when counselling is used in addition to pharmacotherapy, and of more intensive counselling compared to a brief counselling intervention.},

	doi = {10.1186/1748-5908-4-75},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in interventions that can support patients who face difficult decisions and individuals who need to modify their behaviour to achieve better outcomes. Evidence for effectiveness is used to categorize patients care. Effective care is where evidence of benefit outweighs harm: patients should always receive this type of care, where indicated. Preference-sensitive care describes a situation where the evidence for the superiority of one treatment over another is either not available or does not allow differentiation; in this situation, there are two or more valid approaches, and the best choice depends on how individuals value the risks and benefits of treatments. DISCUSSION: Preference-sensitive decisions are defined by equipoise: situations where options need to be deliberated. Moreover, where both healthcare professionals and patients agree that equipoise exists, situations may be regarded as having 'dual equipoise'. Such conditions are ideal for shared decision making. However, there are many situations in medicine where dual equipoise does not exist, where health professionals hold the view that scientific evidence for benefit strongly outweighs harm. This is often the case where people suffer from chronic conditions, and where behaviour change is recommended to improve outcomes. However, some patients, are either ambivalent or find it difficult to sustain optimal behaviours, i.e., patients will be in varying degrees of equipoise. Therefore, situations where dual equipoise exists (or not) help to clarify the definitions of two classes of support, namely, decision and behaviour change support interventions. Decision support interventions help people think about choices they face; they describe where and why choice exists, in short, conditions of dual equipoise; they provide information about options, including, where reasonable, the option of taking no action. These interventions help people to deliberate, independently or in collaboration with others, about options by considering relevant attributes; they support people to forecast how they might feel about short, intermediate, and long-term outcomes that have relevant consequences, in ways that help the process of constructing preferences and eventual decision making appropriate to their individual situation. Whereas, behavioural support interventions describe, justify, and recommend actions that, over time, lead to predictable outcomes over short, intermediate, and long-term timeframes, and that have relevant and important consequences for those who are considering behaviour change. SUMMARY: Decision and behaviour support interventions have divergent aims, different relationships to equipoise, and form two classes of interventions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare patients' evaluation of the treatment decision-making process in localized prostate cancer between counseling that included an online decision aid (DA) and standard counseling. METHODS: Eighteen Dutch hospitals were randomized to DA counseling (n = 235) or the control group with standard counseling (n = 101) in a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial. The DA was provided to patients at, or soon after diagnosis. Decisional conflict, involvement, knowledge, and satisfaction with information were assessed with a questionnaire after treatment decision-making. Anxiety and depression served as covariates. RESULTS: The levels of decision involvement and conflict were comparable between patients in both groups. Patients with a DA felt more knowledgeable but scored equally well on a knowledge test as patients without a DA. Small significant negative effects were found on satisfaction with information and preparation for decision-making. A preference for print over online and depression and anxiety symptoms was negatively associated with satisfaction and conflict scores in the DA group. DISCUSSION: The DA aimed to support shared decision-making, while outcomes for a majority of DA users were comparable to patients who received standard counseling. Patients, who are less comfortable with the online DA format or experience anxiety or depression symptoms, could require more guidance toward shared decision-making. To evaluate long-term DA effects, follow-up evaluation on treatment satisfaction and decisional regret will be done.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe 2013 update of the evidence informing the quality dimensions behind the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) offered a model process for developers of patient decision aids.ObjectiveTo summarize and update the evidence used to inform the systematic development of patient decision aids from the IPDAS Collaboration.MethodsTo provide further details about design and development methods, we summarized findings from a subgroup (n = 283 patient decision aid projects) in a recent systematic review of user involvement by Vaisson et al. Using a new measure of user-centeredness (UCD-11), we then rated the degree of user-centeredness reported in 66 articles describing patient decision aid development and citing the 2013 IPDAS update on systematic development. We contacted the 66 articles? authors to request their self-reports of UCD-11 items.ResultsThe 283 development processes varied substantially from minimal iteration cycles to more complex processes, with multiple iterations, needs assessments, and extensive involvement of end users. We summarized minimal, medium, and maximal processes from the data. Authors of 54 of 66 articles (82\%) provided self-reported UCD-11 ratings. Self-reported scores were significantly higher than reviewer ratings (reviewers: mean [SD] = 6.45 [3.10]; authors: mean [SD] = 9.62 [1.16], P {\textless} 0.001).ConclusionsDecision aid developers have embraced principles of user-centered design in the development of patient decision aids while also underreporting aspects of user involvement in publications about their tools. Templates may reduce the need for extensive development, and new approaches for rapid development of aids have been proposed when a more detailed approach is not feasible. We provide empirically derived benchmark processes and a reporting checklist to support developers in more fully describing their development processes.HighlightsUsers of patient decision aids deserve assurance that the processes used to create these tools follow acceptable standards.Since the last update of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards, principles of user-centered design have been widely adopted by developers.Developers consistently underreport the involvement of users when describing the development of decision aids.Templates and a checklist may help developers more fully report on the processes they use in creating these tools.},

	abstract = {Background: Processing Web-based health information can be difficult, especially for people with low health literacy. Presentinghealth information in an audiovisual format, such as animation, is expected to improve understanding among low health literateaudiences. Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate what features of spoken health animations improve information recall and attitudes and whether there are differences between health literacy groups. Methods: We conducted an online experiment among 231 participants aged 55 years or older with either low or high health literacy. A 2 (spoken vs written text) x 2 (illustration vs animation) design was used. Participants were randomly exposed to one of the four experimental messages, all providing the same information on colorectal cancer screening. Results: The results showed that, among people with low health literacy, spoken messages about colorectal cancer screening improved recall (P=.03) and attitudes (P=.02) compared to written messages. Animations alone did not improve recall, but when combined with spoken text, they significantly improved recall in this group (P=.02). When exposed to spoken animations, people with low health literacy recalled the same amount of information as their high health literate counterparts (P=.12), whereas in all other conditions people with high health literacy recalled more information compared to low health literate individuals. For people with low health literacy, positive attitudes mediated the relationship between spoken text and the intention to have a colorectal cancer screening (b=.12; 95\% CI 0.02-0.25). Conclusions: We conclude that spoken animation is the best way to communicate complex health information to people with low health literacy. This format can even bridge the information processing gap between audiences with low and high health literacy as the recall differences between the two groups are eliminated. As animations do not negatively influence high health literate audiences, it is concluded that information adapted to audiences with low health literacy suits people with high health literacy as well.},

We searched online repositories and emailed authors to access PtDAs to verify grade reading level, understandability, and actionability.Data SynthesisTwenty-five of 213 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, illustrating that only 12\% of studies addressed the needs of low health literacy or other socially-disadvantaged groups. Grade reading level was calculated in 8 of 25 studies (33\%), which is recommended in previous IPDAS guidelines. We accessed and independently assessed 11 PtDAs. None were written at sixth-grade level or below. Ten PtDAs met the recommended threshold for understandability, but only 5 met the recommended threshold for actionability. We also conducted a post hoc subgroup meta-analysis and found that knowledge improvements after receiving a PtDA were greater in studies that reported using strategies to reduce cognitive demand in PtDA development compared with studies that did not (?2 = 14.11, P = 0.0002, I2 = 92.9\%).LimitationsWe were unable to access 13 of 24 PtDAs. Conclusions. Greater attention to health literacy and socially-disadvantaged populations is needed in the field of PtDAs to ensure equity in decision support.},

	abstract = {Background: Web-based computer-tailored interventions for multiple health behaviors can have a significant public health impact. Yet, few randomized controlled trials have tested this assumption. Objective: The objective of this paper was to test the effects of a sequential and simultaneous Web-based tailored intervention on multiple lifestyle behaviors. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 3 tailoring conditions (ie, sequential, simultaneous, and control conditions) in the Netherlands in 2009-2012. Follow-up measurements took place after 12 and 24 months. The intervention content was based on the I-Change model. In a health risk appraisal, all respondents (N=5055) received feedback on their lifestyle behaviors that indicated whether they complied with the Dutch guidelines for physical activity, vegetable consumption, fruit consumption, alcohol intake, and smoking. Participants in the sequential (n=1736) and simultaneous (n=1638) conditions received tailored motivational feedback to change unhealthy behaviors one at a time (sequential) or all at the same time (simultaneous). Mixed model analyses were performed as primary analyses; regression analyses were done as sensitivity analyses. An overall risk score was used as outcome measure, then effects on the 5 individual lifestyle behaviors were assessed and a process evaluation was performed regarding exposure to and appreciation of the intervention. Results: Both tailoring strategies were associated with small self-reported behavioral changes. The sequential condition had the most significant effects compared to the control condition after 12 months (T1, effect size=0.28). After 24 months (T2), the simultaneous condition was most effective (effect size=0.18). All 5 individual lifestyle behaviors changed over time, but few effects differed significantly between the conditions. At both follow-ups, the sequential condition had significant changes in smoking abstinence compared to the simultaneous condition (T1 effect size=0.31; T2 effect size=0.41). The sequential condition was more effective in decreasing alcohol consumption than the control condition at 24 months (effect size=0.27). Change was predicted by the amount of exposure to the intervention (total visiting time: beta=–.06; P=.01; total number of visits: beta=–.11; P{\textless}.001). Both interventions were appreciated well by respondents without significant differences between conditions. Conclusions: Although evidence was found for the effectiveness of both programs, no simple conclusive finding could be drawn about which intervention mode was more effective. The best kind of intervention may depend on the behavior that is targeted or on personal preferences and motivation. Further research is needed to identify moderators of intervention effectiveness. The results need to be interpreted in view of the high and selective dropout rates, multiple comparisons, and modest effect sizes. However, a large number of people were reached at low cost and behavioral change was achieved after 2 years.

	abstract = {Background: Online health communication has the potential to reach large audiences, with the additional advantages that it can be operational at all times and that the costs per visitor are low. Furthermore, research shows that Internet-delivered interventions can be effective in changing health behaviors. However, exposure to Internet-delivered health-communication programs is generally low. Research investigating predictors of exposure is needed to be able to effectively disseminate online interventions. Objective: In the present study, the authors used a longitudinal design with the aim of identifying demographic, psychological, and behavioral predictors of visiting, using, and revisiting an online program promoting physical activity in the general population. Methods: A webpage was created providing the public with information about health and healthy behavior. The website included a \&\#8220;physical activity check,\&\#8221; which consisted of a physical activity computer-tailoring expert system where visitors could check whether their physical activity levels were in line with recommendations. Visitors who consented to participate in the present study (n = 489) filled in a questionnaire that assessed demographics, mode of recruitment, current physical activity levels, and health motivation. Immediately after, participants received tailored feedback concerning their current physical activity levels and completed a questionnaire assessing affective and cognitive user experience, attitude toward being sufficiently physically active, and intention to be sufficiently physically active. Three months later, participants received an email inviting them once more to check whether their physical activity level had changed. Results: Analyses of visiting showed that more women (67.5\%) than men (32.5\%) visited the program. With regard to continued use, native Dutch participants (odds ratio [OR] = 2.81, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-6.81, P = .02) and participants with a strong motivation to be healthy (OR = 1.46, CI = 1.03-2.07, P = .03) were most likely to continue usage of the program. With regard to revisiting, older participants (OR = 1.04, CI = 1.01-1.06, P = .01) and highly educated participants (OR = 4.69, CI = 1.44-15.22, P = .01) were more likely to revisit the program after three months. In addition, positive affective user experience predicted revisiting (OR = 1.64, CI = 1.12-2.39, P = .01). Conclusions: The results suggest that online interventions could specifically target men, young people, immigrant groups, people with a low education, and people with a weak health motivation to increase exposure to these interventions. Furthermore, eliciting positive feelings in visitors may contribute to higher usage rates.},

	abstract = {In an ongoing effort of this Journal to develop and further the theories, models, and best practices around eHealth research, this paper argues for the need for a “science of attrition”, that is, a need to develop models for discontinuation of eHealth applications and the related phenomenon of participants dropping out of eHealth trials. What I call “law of attrition” here is the observation that in any eHealth trial a substantial proportion of users drop out before completion or stop using the appplication. This feature of eHealth trials is a distinct characteristic compared to, for example, drug trials. The traditional clinical trial and evidence-based medicine paradigm stipulates that high dropout rates make trials less believable. Consequently eHealth researchers tend to gloss over high dropout rates, or not to publish their study results at all, as they see their studies as failures. However, for many eHealth trials, in particular those conducted on the Internet and in particular with self-help applications, high dropout rates may be a natural and typical feature. Usage metrics and determinants of attrition should be highlighted, measured, analyzed, and discussed. This also includes analyzing and reporting the characteristics of the subpopulation for which the application eventually “works”, ie, those who stay in the trial and use it. For the question of what works and what does not, such attrition measures are as important to report as pure efficacy measures from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. In cases of high dropout rates efficacy measures underestimate the impact of an application on a population which continues to use it. Methods of analyzing attrition curves can be drawn from survival analysis methods, eg, the Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards regression analysis (Cox model). Measures to be reported include the relative risk of dropping out or of stopping the use of an application, as well as a “usage half-life”, and models reporting demographic and other factors predicting usage discontinuation in a population. Differential dropout or usage rates between two interventions could be a standard metric for the “usability efficacy” of a system. A “run-in and withdrawal” trial design is suggested as a methodological innovation for Internet-based trials with a high number of initial dropouts/nonusers and a stable group of hardcore users.},

	abstract = {Background:
To expedite the use of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions (EBSCIs) in primary care and to thereby increase the number of successful quit attempts, a referral aid was developed. This aid aims to optimize the referral to and use of EBSCIs in primary care and to increase adherence to Dutch guidelines for smoking cessation.


Methods:
Practice nurses (PNs) will be randomly allocated to an experimental condition or control condition, and will then recruit smoking patients who show a willingness to quit smoking within six months. PNs allocated to the experimental condition will provide smoking cessation guidance in accordance with the referral aid. Patients from both conditions will receive questionnaires at baseline and after six months. Cessation effectiveness will be tested via multilevel logistic regression analyses. Multiple imputations as well as intention to treat analysis will be performed. Intervention appreciation and level of informed decision-making will be compared using analysis of (co)variance. Predictors for appreciation and informed decision-making will be assessed using multiple linear regression analysis and/or structural equation modeling. Finally, a cost-effectiveness study will be conducted.


Discussion:
This paper describes the study design for the development and evaluation of an information and decision tool to support PNs in their guidance of smoking patients and their referral to EBSCIs. The study aims to provide insight into the (cost) effectiveness of an intervention aimed at expediting the use of EBSCIs in primary care.},

Very few studies reported data on the performance and clinical sensibility of measures, with reliability (23\%) and validity (6\%) being the most common. Studies using new measures were less likely to include information about their psychometric performance compared with previously published measures.LimitationsThe review was limited to reporting of measures in studies included in the Cochrane review and did not consult prior publications.ConclusionThere continues to be very little reported about the development or performance of measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of PtDAs in published trials.

	abstract = {Computer-tailored (CT) digital health interventions have shown to be effective in obtaining behaviour change. Yet, user perceptions of these interventions are often unsatisfactory. Traditional CT interventions rely mostly on text-based feedback messages. A way of presenting feedback messages in a more engaging manner may be the use of narrated animations instead of text. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of manipulating the mode of delivery (animation vs. text) in a smoking cessation intervention on user perceptions among smokers and non-smokers. Smokers and non-smokers (N = 181) were randomized into either the animation or text condition. Participants in the animation condition assessed the intervention as more effective (ηp2 = .035), more trustworthy (ηp2 = .048), more enjoyable (ηp2 = .022), more aesthetic (ηp2 = .233), and more engaging (ηp2 = .043) compared to participants in the text condition. Participants that received animations compared to text messages also reported to actively trust the intervention more (ηp2 = .039) and graded the intervention better (ηp2 = .056). These findings suggest that animation-based interventions are superior to text-based interventions with respect to user perceptions.},

	abstract = {Background
In western countries, smoking prevalence rates are high among smokers unmotivated to quit and those with a lower socioeconomic status (LSES). Multiple computer tailoring and the use of audio-visual aids may improve such interventions and increase cessation in LSES smokers. This study assessed the 12-month effectiveness of a video- and text-based computer-tailored intervention.
Methods
A randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands was used in which smokers were allocated to the video-based condition (VC) (N=670), the text-based condition (TC) (N=708) or the control condition (CC) (brief generic text advice) (N=721). After 12months, self-reported prolonged abstinence was assessed and biochemically verified in respondents indicating to have quit smoking. Three analysis strategies were used to assess the effects: (1) multiple imputation (MI); (2) intention-to-treat (ITT); (3) complete case analysis (CC).
Results
VC was more effective in prolonged abstinence compared to CC (odds ratio (OR)=1.90, p=.005) and the text-based condition (OR=1.71, p=.01). VC was furthermore more effective than TC. No differences were found for SES and motivational levels. Results were similar when using ITT and CC. For our secondary outcome seven-day point prevalence abstinence; however, neither VC (OR=1.17, p=.34) or TC (OR=0.91, p=.52) outperformed the CC.
Conclusion
The video-based computer-tailored intervention was effective in obtaining substantial long-term abstinence compared to the text-based version and a brief generic text advice.},

Evidence to date is mainly derived from highly controlled settings; if clinicians and health care organizations are expected to embed PtDAs as a means to support person-centered care, we need to better understand what this might look like outside of a research setting.AimThis review was conducted in response to the IPDAS Collaboration?s evidence update process, which informs their published standards for PtDA quality and effectiveness. The aim was to develop context-specific program theories that explain why and how PtDAs are successfully implemented in routine healthcare settings.MethodsRapid realist review methodology was used to identify articles that could contribute to theory development. We engaged key experts and stakeholders to identify key sources; this was supplemented by electronic database (Medline and CINAHL), gray literature, and forward/backward search strategies. Initial theories were refined to develop realist context-mechanism-outcome configurations, and these were mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.ResultsWe developed 8 refined theories, using data from 23 implementation studies (29 articles), to describe the mechanisms by which PtDAs become successfully implemented into routine clinical settings. Recommended implementation strategies derived from the program theory include 1) co-production of PtDA content and processes (or local adaptation), 2) training the entire team, 3) preparing and prompting patients to engage, 4) senior-level buy-in, and 5) measuring to improve.ConclusionsWe recommend key strategies that organizations and individuals intending to embed PtDAs routinely can use as a practical guide. Further work is needed to understand the importance of context in the success of different implementation studies.},

	abstract = {Background. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are effective interventions to support patient involvement in health care decisions, but there is little use in practice. Our study aimed to determine subsequent PtDA use in clinical practice following published randomized controlled trials. Design. A descriptive study using an e-mail-embedded questionnaire survey targeting authors of 133 trials included in Cochrane Reviews of PtDAs (106 authors). We classified PtDA level of use as a) implementation, defined as integrating within care processes; b) dissemination to target users with planned strategies; and c) diffusion, defined as passive, unplanned spread. We conducted content analysis to identify barriers and enablers guided by the Ottawa Model of Research Use. Results. Ninety-eight authors responded (92.5\%) on 108 trialed PtDAs. Reported levels of use were implementation (n = 29; 28\%), dissemination to target user(s) (n = 9; 9\%), and diffusion (n = 7; 7\%); 57 (55\%) reported no uptake, and 1 had no response (1\%). Barriers to use in clinical practice were identified at the level of researchers (e.g., lack of posttrial plan), PtDAs (e.g., outdated, delivery mechanism), clinicians (e.g., disagreed with PtDA use), and practice environment (e.g., infrastructure support; funding). Enablers were online delivery, organizational endorsement (e.g., professional organization, charity, government), and design for and integration into the care process. Limitations. Self-report bias and potential for recall bias. Conclusions. Only 44\% of PtDA trial authors indicated some level of subsequent use following their trial. The most commonly reported barriers were lack of funding, outdated PtDAs, and clinician disagreement with PtDA use. To improve subsequent use, researchers should codesign PtDAs with end users to ensure fit with clinical practice and develop an implementation plan. National systems (e.g., platforms, endorsement, funding) can enable use.},

	abstract = {Background: Our decision aid on mammography screening developed according to the criteria of the International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration increases knowledge compared to usual care. However, it remains unclear whether this decision aid is more effective in women with higher eHealth literacy. Our objective was to test whether the positive effect of the decision aid on knowledge is moderated by eHealth literacy.Methods: A total of 1,206 women aged 50 from Westphalia-Lippe, Germany, participated (response rate of 16.3\%) in our study and were randomized to usual care (i.e., the standard information brochure sent with the programme's invitation letter) or the decision aid. eHealth literacy was assessed at baseline with the Electronic Health Literacy Scale (eHEALS); knowledge was assessed at baseline and post-intervention. First, we compared the 2-factor model of the German eHEALS (information-seeking and information-appraisal) found in previous research and the 3-factor model we hypothesized for decision aid use to the originally proposed 1-factor model. Second, we modeled the measurement model according to the superior factor model found in step one and tested whether the eHEALS moderated the effect of the decision aid on knowledge.Results: The 3-factor model of the eHEALS had a better model fit than the 1-factor or 2-factor model. Both information-seeking, information-appraisal, and information-use had no effect on knowledge post-intervention. All three interactions of the decision aid with information-seeking, information-appraisal, and information-use were not significant. Equally, neither education nor its interaction with the decision aid had an effect on knowledge post-intervention.Conclusion: The decision aid developed in this project increases knowledge irrespective of level of eHealth literacy. This means that not only women with high eHealth literacy profit from the decision aid but that the decision aid has been successfully conceptualized as a comprehensible information tool that can be used by women of varying eHealth literacy levels.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00005176 (https://www.drks.de/drks\_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML\&TRIAL\_ID=DRKS00005176).},

	abstract = {Background: A wide range of effective smoking cessation interventions have been developed to help smokers to quit. Smoking rates remain high, especially among people with a lower level of education. Multiple tailoring adapted to the individual’s readiness to quit and the use of visual messaging may increase smoking cessation. Objective: The results of video and text computer tailoring were compared with the results of a control condition. Main effects and differential effects for subgroups with different educational levels and different levels of readiness to quit were assessed. Methods: During a blind randomized controlled trial, smokers willing to quit within 6 months were assigned to a video computer tailoring group with video messages (n=670), a text computer tailoring group with text messages (n=708), or to a control condition with short generic text advice (n=721). After 6 months, effects on 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Analyses were conducted in 2 samples: (1) respondents (as randomly assigned) who filled in the baseline questionnaire and completed the first session of the program, and (2) a subsample of sample 1, excluding respondents who did not adhere to at least one further intervention session. In primary analyses, we used a negative scenario in which respondents lost to follow-up were classified as smokers. Complete case analysis and multiple imputation analyses were considered as secondary analyses. Results: In sample 1, the negative scenario analyses revealed that video computer tailoring was more effective in increasing 7-day point prevalence abstinence than the control condition (OR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.09-1.94, P=.01). Video computer tailoring also resulted in significantly higher prolonged abstinence rates than controls among smokers with a low (ready to quit within 4-6 months) readiness to quit (OR 5.13, 95\% CI 1.76-14.92, P=.003). Analyses of sample 2 showed similar results, although text computer tailoring was also more effective than control in realizing 7-day point prevalence abstinence. No differential effects were found for level of education. Complete case analyses and multiple imputation yielded similar results. Conclusions: In all analyses, video computer tailoring was effective in realizing smoking cessation. Furthermore, video computer tailoring was especially successful for smokers with a low readiness to quit smoking. Text computer tailoring was only effective for sample 2. Results suggest that video-based messages with personalized feedback adapted to the smoker’s motivation to quit might be effective in increasing abstinence rates for smokers with diverse educational levels.

	abstract = {Background A recent rigorous study has shown that cytisine, a low-cost drug, is effective for smoking cessation. A number of earlier studies exist, mostly from former communist countries where cytisine has been used since the 1960s. The key question now is whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant licensing cytisine or whether more work is needed. A systematic review was undertaken to assess the efficacy of cytisine in smoking cessation. Methods The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant data. Data from controlled trials were entered into two separate meta-analyses. The first considered the strictest definition of outcome and longest follow-up from all available studies and the second pooled outcomes from studies with biochemically validated abstinence and follow-up of 6 months or longer. Results Eight controlled trials were identified. Seven trials provided extractable data and, when pooled (first meta-analysis), produced a risk ratio (RR) of 1.57 (95\% CI 1.42 to 1.74). Data from two high-quality studies (second meta-analysis) produced a pooled RR of 3.29 (95\% CI 1.84 to 5.90). Patients on cytisine reported more gastrointestinal symptoms than patients on placebo (RR=1.76, 95\% CI 1.28 to 2.42). There was no difference in overall reports of adverse events and no specific safety concerns emerged. Conclusions Cytisine is an effective treatment for smoking cessation with efficacy comparable to that of other currently licensed treatments. Given its low cost and potential for public health benefit, expedited licensing of cytisine for smoking cessation is warranted.},

	abstract = {Objective
To provide a systematic review of self-administered decision aids (DAs) for citizens invited to participate in colorectal cancer screening synthesizing the effectiveness of self-administered DAs on informed choice or the components hereof; knowledge, attitudes, and participation.
Methods
The literature search was undertaken in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and Scopus and last updated 19 March 2021. Results were presented by narrative synthesis, meta-analyses and vote counting based on direction of effect.
Results
Fourteen studies of fair methodological quality were included. One study reported on informed choice and 13 studies reported on the components. Self-administered DAs increased participation and knowledge whereas it was inconclusive with regard to attitudes towards screening. The studies were very heterogeneous with different comparators, outcomes and means of measurement.
Conclusion
This systematic review showed a potential for self-administered DAs to support informed choice in colorectal cancer screening, especially by increasing knowledge.
Practice Implications
It seems reasonable to consider informed choice to be one of the main outcomes of self-administered DAs. Yet there is a need for consensus on how to measure informed choice in cancer screening, especially a validated measurement of knowledge defining what constitutes 'adequate knowledge'.},

We explored decisional conflict as measured with the 16-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and how it varies across clinical situations, decision types, and exposure to decision support interventions (DESIs). Methods. An exhaustive scoping review was conducted using backward citation searches and keyword searches. Eligible studies were published between 1995 and March 2015, used an original experimental/observational research design, concerned a health-related decision, and provided DCS data. Dyads independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, and extracted data. We performed narrative syntheses and calculated average or median DCS scores. Results. We included 246 articles reporting on 253 studies. DCS scores ranged from 2.4 to 79.7 out of 100. Highest baseline DCS scores were for care planning (44.8 ± 8.9, median = 47.0) and treatment decisions (32.5 ± 12.6, median = 31.9), in contexts of primary care (40.6 ± 18.3), and geriatrics (39.8 ± 11.2). Baseline scores were high among decision makers who were ill (33.2 ± 14.1, median = 30.2) or making decisions for themselves (33.4 ± 13.8, median = 32.0). Total DCS scores {\textless}25 out of 100 were associated with implementing decisions. Without DESIs, DCS scores tended to increase shortly after decision making ({\textgreater}37.4). After DESI use, DCS scores decreased short-term but increased or remained the same long-term ({\textgreater}6 months). Conclusions. DCS scores were highest at baseline and decreased after decision making. DESIs decreased decisional conflict immediately after decision making. The largest improvements after DESIs were in decision makers who were ill or made decisions for themselves. Further meta-analyses are needed for decision type, contexts, and interventions to inform hypotheses about the expected effects of DESIs, the best timing for measurement, and interpretation of DCS scores.},

Results A total of 172 RCTs with 89?639 participants. Eligibility [median 57.6\%; interquartile range (IQR) = 34.7?83.7], recruitment (median 66.4\%; IQR = 42.7?85.2) and retention rates (median 80.5\%; IQR = 68.5?89.5) varied considerably across studies. For eligibility rates, the recruitment strategy appeared not to be associated with eligibility rates. For recruitment rates, use of indirect recruitment strategies (e.g. public announcements) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.30, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.11?0.82] and self-help interventions (OR = 0.14, 95\% CI = 0.03?0.67) were associated with lower recruitment rates. For retention rates, higher retention was seen if the sample had ongoing physical health condition/s (OR = 1.66, 95\% CI = 1.04?2.63), whereas lower retention was seen amongst primarily female samples (OR = 0.83, 95\% CI = 0.71?0.98) and those motivated to quit smoking (OR = 0.74, 95\% CI = 0.55?0.99) when indirect recruitment methods were used (OR = 0.60, 95\% CI = 0.38?0.97) and at longer follow-up assessments (OR = 0.83, 95\% CI = 0.79?0.87). For differential retention, higher retention in the intervention group occurred when the intervention but not comparator group received financial incentives for smoking cessation (OR = 1.35, 95\% CI = 1.02?1.77). Conclusions In randomized controlled trials of behavioural smoking cessation interventions, recruitment and retention rates appear to be higher for smoking cessation interventions that include a person-to-person rather than at-a-distance contact; male participants, smokers with chronic conditions, smokers not initially motivated to quit and shorter follow-up assessments seems to be associated with improved retention; financial incentive interventions improve retention in groups receiving them relative to comparison groups.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Evidence-based cessation assistance is known to increase cessation rates. Activating personal preferences as part of the decision for smoking cessation assistance tools could further improve tools' effectiveness. Decision aids (DAs) help individuals to choose amongst the various options by taking these preferences into account and, therefore, could have a positive effect on cessation rates. To develop attractive and effective DAs, potential end users' needs, and experts' viewpoints should be considered during development processes. Therefore, the aim of this study was: (1) To explore smokers' needs and viewpoints regarding a smoking cessation assistance DA, and (2) to obtain consensus among smoking cessation counsellors and scientific experts about the content and format of such a DA. Materials and methods: Data was gathered via two approaches applied across three studies: (1) 20 semi-structured interviews with potential end users, (2) two three-round Delphi studies with 61 smoking cessation counsellors and 44 scientific experts. Data from the interviews and the first round of the Delphi studies were analysed qualitatively using the Framework method, while data from the second and third round of the Delphi studies were analysed quantitatively using medians and interquartile ranges. Results: Potential end users reported to acquire information in different ways: Via own experiences, their social environment, and the media. Important characteristics to decide between tools also varied, however effectiveness and costs were commonly reported as the most important characteristics. The experts reached consensus on 38 and 40 statements (respectively) regarding important cessation assistance tools' characteristics and their viewpoints on a smoking cessation assistance DA, e.g., that a tool should be appropriate for users' level of addiction. Discussion and conclusion: Some clear trends emerged among the potential end users (especially regarding important characteristics). Experts also reached consensus among a number of statements. However, there was some variation in the needs and wishes among the (different) stakeholders. The combination of these studies highlights that a 'one size fits all' approach is not desirable. In the development of DAs, this heterogeneity should be taken into account, e.g., by enabling users to customize a DA based on their personal preferences while safeguarding essential elements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant from the Dutch Cancer Society (UM2015-7744).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Evaluation of this project by the Medical Ethics Committee METC Z (16-N-227) revealed that this project did not require medical ethics approval under the rules of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO).All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Self-determination theory has been applied to the prediction of a number of health-related behaviors with self-determined or autonomous forms of motivation generally more effective in predicting health behavior than non-self-determined or controlled forms. Research has been confined to examining the motivational predictors in single health behaviors rather than comparing effects across multiple behaviors. The present study addressed this gap in the literature by testing the relative contribution of autonomous and controlling motivation to the prediction of a large number of health-related behaviors, and examining individual differences in self-determined motivation as a moderator of the effects of autonomous and controlling motivation on health behavior. Participants were undergraduate students (N = 140) who completed measures of autonomous and controlled motivational regulations and behavioral intention for 20 health-related behaviors at an initial occasion with follow-up behavioral measures taken four weeks later. Path analysis was used to test a process model for each behavior in which motivational regulations predicted behavior mediated by intentions. Some minor idiosyncratic findings aside, between-participants analyses revealed significant effects for autonomous motivational regulations on intentions and behavior across the 20 behaviors. Effects for controlled motivation on intentions and behavior were relatively modest by comparison. Intentions mediated the effect of autonomous motivation on behavior. Within-participants analyses were used to segregate the sample into individuals who based their intentions on autonomous motivation (autonomy-oriented) and controlled motivation (control-oriented). Replicating the between-participants path analyses for the process model in the autonomy- and control-oriented samples did not alter the relative effects of the motivational orientations on intention and behavior. Results provide evidence for consistent effects of autonomous motivation on intentions and behavior across multiple health-related behaviors with little evidence of moderation by individual differences. Findings have implications for the generalizability of proposed effects in self-determination theory and intentions as a mediator of distal motivational factors on health-related behavior.},

MEDLINE, all EBM Reviews, CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar, manual search of reference lists, and expert contacts. Study Selection. Articles were included if they described the evaluation of 1 or more explicit values clarification methods. Data Extraction. We extracted details about the evaluation, whether it was conducted in the context of actual or hypothetical decisions, and the results of the evaluation. We combined these data with data from a previous review about each values clarification method?s design features. Data Synthesis. We identified 20 evaluations of values clarification methods within 19 articles. Reported outcomes were heterogeneous. Few studies reported values congruence or postdecision outcomes. The most promising design feature identified was explicitly showing people the implications of their values, for example, by displaying the extent to which each of their decision options aligns with what matters to them. Limitations. Because of the heterogeneity of outcomes, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. Results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions. Few values clarification methods have been evaluated experimentally. More research is needed to determine effects of different design features of values clarification methods and to establish best practices in values clarification. When feasible, evaluations should assess values congruence and postdecision measures of longer-term outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background. High-quality health decisions are often defined as those that are both evidence informed and values congruent. A values-congruent decision aligns with what matters to those most affected by the decision. Values clarification methods are intended to support values-congruent decisions, but their effects on values congruence are rarely evaluated. Methods. We tested 11 strategies, including the 3 most commonly used values clarification methods, across 6 between-subjects online randomized experiments in demographically diverse US populations (n1 = 1346, n2 = 456, n3 = 840, n4 = 1178, n5 = 841, n6 = 2033) in the same hypothetical decision. Our primary outcome was values congruence. Decisional conflict was a secondary outcome in studies 3 to 6. Results. Two commonly used values clarification methods (pros and cons, rating scales) reduced decisional conflict but did not encourage values-congruent decisions. Strategies using mathematical models to show participants which option aligned with what mattered to them encouraged values-congruent decisions and reduced decisional conflict when assessed. Limitations. A hypothetical decision was necessary for ethical reasons, as we believed some strategies may harm decision quality. Later studies used more outcomes and covariates. Results may not generalize outside US-based adults with online access. We assumed validity and stability of values during the brief experiments. Conclusions. Failing to explicitly support the process of aligning options with values leads to increased proportions of values-incongruent decisions. Methods representing more than half of values clarification methods commonly in use failed to encourage values-congruent decisions. Methods that use models to explicitly show people how options align with their values offer more promise for helping people make decisions aligned with what matters to them. Decisional conflict, while arguably an important outcome in and of itself, is not an appropriate proxy for values congruence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95\% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95\% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95\% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95\% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95\% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95\% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70\%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.},

From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods.Data ExtractionTwo independent reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its evaluation.Data SynthesisCompared to control conditions or to implicit values clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-incongruent choices (risk difference, ?0.04; 95\% confidence interval [CI], ?0.06 to ?0.02; P {\textless} 0.001) and decisional conflict (standardized mean difference, ?0.20; 95\% CI, ?0.29 to ?0.11; P {\textless} 0.001). Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods (?2 = 9.25, P = 0.01). There were no differences between different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (?2 = 6.08, P = 0.05).LimitationsSome meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. We grouped values clarification methods into broad categories.ConclusionsCurrent evidence suggests patient decision aids should include an explicit values clarification method. Developers may wish to specifically consider multicriteria decision analysis. Future evaluations of values clarification methods should report their effects on decisional conflict, decisions made, values congruence, and decisional regret.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to construct a measure of informed decision making that includes knowledge, deliberation, and value-consistency, and to assess the level of informed decision making about prenatal screening, and differences between test acceptors and test decliners.
Methods
Women attending one of 44 midwifery and gynaecology practices were asked to fill out postal questionnaires before and after the prenatal screening offer. The principal outcome was the level of informed decision making. For this purpose, knowledge about prenatal screening, deliberation about the pros and cons of the alternatives, test uptake, and attitude towards having a prenatal screening test were measured.
Results
Eighty-four percent of the participants were sufficiently knowledgeable about prenatal screening, 75\% of the decisions were deliberate, and 82\% were value-consistent. Fifty-one percent of the participants made an informed decision. Test acceptors made less informed decisions as compared to test decliners. This difference was mainly caused by the lower rate of deliberation in this group.
Conclusion
It appears from this study that prenatal screening decisions are often not informed decisions. This is inconsistent with the main objective of offering screening, which is to enable people to make informed decisions.
Practice implications
Decision makers should be encouraged during the counselling to deliberate about the various alternatives.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Rigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease.
Methods
GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. (1) We included 560 risk–outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies. 12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk–outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30 652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden.
Findings
The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10·8 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51–12·1) deaths (19·2\% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12–9·31) deaths (15·4\% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253–350) DALYs (11·6\% [10·3–13·1] of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0–9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10–24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25–49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50–74 years and 75 years and older.
Interpretation
Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

This has been explored in detail by a number of authors but is still hotly debated, and some say little understood. A sample of PhD studies using qualitative approaches, and qualitative interviews as the method of data collection was taken from theses.com and contents analysed for their sample sizes. Five hundred and sixty studies were identified that fitted the inclusion criteria. Results showed that the mean sample size was 31; however, the distribution was non-random, with a statistically significant proportion of studies, presenting sample sizes that were multiples of ten. These results are discussed in relation to saturation. They suggest a pre-meditated approach that is not wholly congruent with the principles of qualitative research. URN: urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs100387},

Cigarette smoking results in more than \$193 billion in medical costs and productivity losses annually.In an effort to reduce this burden, many states, the federal government, and several national organizations fund tobacco control programs and policies. For this report we reviewed existing literature on economic evaluations of tobacco control interventions. We found that smoking cessation therapies, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and self-help are most commonly studied. There are far fewer studies on other important interventions, such as price and tax increases, media campaigns, smoke free air laws and workplace smoking interventions, quitlines, youth access enforcement, school-based programs, and community-based programs. Although there are obvious gaps in the literature, the existing studies show in almost every case that tobacco control programs and policies are either cost-saving or highly cost-effective.},

	abstract = {Background: Internet-delivered interventions can effectively change health risk behaviors and their determinants, but adherence to these interventions once they are accessed is very low. Therefore, it is relevant and necessary to systematically manipulate website characteristics to test their effect on website use. This study focuses on user control as a website characteristic. Objective: To test whether and how user control (the freedom of choice to skip pages) can increase website use and knowledge gained from the website. Methods: Participants older than 18 years were drawn from the Dutch Internet population (in June 2011) and completed a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire. Subsequently, they were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) a tunneled version of the website with less user control; (2) a high user control version of the website where visitors had the freedom of choice to skip pages; and (3) a control group that was not exposed to the website. Participants completed (1) a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website (except for the control group), and (2) a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire after one week to test whether participants in the experimental groups only clicked through the website or actually processed and learned its content. Server registrations were used to assess website use. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) using all available data were conducted to determine whether user control increases website use. Structural equation models (SEM) using all available data were constructed to test how user control increases website use\&\#8212;a latent variable derived from number of pages visited and time on website. Results: Of the 1044 persons invited to participate, 668 took part (668/1044, 64.0\%). One half of participants (332/668 49.7\%) were female and the mean age was 49 years (SD 16). A total of 571 participants completed the one-week follow-up measure regarding hepatitis knowledge (571/668, 85.5\%). The findings demonstrate that having less user control (ie, a tunneled version of the website) had a negative effect on users\&\#8217; perception of efficiency (F1,452 = 97.69, P \&\#60; .001), but a positive effect on number of pages visited (F1,452 = 171.49, P \&\#60; .001), time on the website (F1,452 = 6.32, P = .01), and knowledge gained from the website (F1,452 = 134.32, P \&\#60; .001). The direct effect of having less user control appeared to surpass the effect mediated by efficiency, because website use was higher among participants exposed to the tunneled version of the website in comparison with those having the freedom of choice to skip pages. Conclusions: The key finding that visitors demonstrated increased website use in the tunneled version of the website indicates that visitors should be carefully guided through the intervention for future intervention websites.},

The use of information technology is a key enabler for empowering patients and supporting patient-centered care. The patient decision aid is one tool for getting patients more involved in their care. However, existing patient decision aids make generalized assumptions about their users and fail to accommodate the variability of individual information needs and decision-making preferences known in the literature. In this paper, we investigate patient attributes that influence patient decision-making preferences and present a framework for the design of individualized patient decision aids. The proposed framework is instantiated in the context of end stage renal disease and was tested to evaluate its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background: At any given time, most smokers in a population are ambivalent with no motivation to quit. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based technique that aims to elicit change in ambivalent smokers. MI practitioners are scarce and expensive, and smokers are difficult to reach. Smokers are potentially reachable through the web, and if an automated chatbot could emulate an MI conversation, it could form the basis of a low-cost and scalable intervention motivating smokers to quit.
Objective: The primary goal of this study is to design, train, and test an automated MI-based chatbot capable of eliciting reflection in a conversation with cigarette smokers. This study describes the process of collecting training data to improve the chatbot’s ability to generate MI-oriented responses, particularly reflections and summary statements. The secondary goal of this study is to observe the effects on participants through voluntary feedback given after completing a conversation with the chatbot.
Methods: An interdisciplinary collaboration between an MI expert and experts in computer engineering and natural language processing (NLP) co-designed the conversation and algorithms underlying the chatbot. A sample of 121 adult cigarette smokers in 11 successive groups were recruited from a web-based platform for a single-arm prospective iterative design study. The chatbot was designed to stimulate reflections on the pros and cons of smoking using MI’s running head start technique. Participants were also asked to confirm the chatbot’s classification of their free-form responses to measure the classification accuracy of the underlying NLP models. Each group provided responses that were used to train the chatbot for the next group.
Results: A total of 6568 responses from 121 participants in 11 successive groups over 14 weeks were received. From these responses, we were able to isolate 21 unique reasons for and against smoking and the relative frequency of each. The gradual collection of responses as inputs and smoking reasons as labels over the 11 iterations improved the F1 score of the classification within the chatbot from 0.63 in the first group to 0.82 in the final group. The mean time spent by each participant interacting with the chatbot was 21.3 (SD 14.0) min (minimum 6.4 and maximum 89.2). We also found that 34.7\% (42/121) of participants enjoyed the interaction with the chatbot, and 8.3\% (10/121) of participants noted explicit smoking cessation benefits from the conversation in voluntary feedback that did not solicit this explicitly.
Conclusions: Recruiting ambivalent smokers through the web is a viable method to train a chatbot to increase accuracy in reflection and summary statements, the building blocks of MI. A new set of 21 smoking reasons (both for and against) has been identified. Initial feedback from smokers on the experience shows promise toward using it in an intervention.},

	abstract = {American Indians (AI) face significant disparities in smoking-related diseases. In addition, smoking prevalence increases exponentially between ages 11 and 18. Smoking prevention and cessation efforts aimed at AI youth therefore are important. In order to strengthen understanding of evidence-based message strategies for smoking prevention and cessation among AI youth. The objective of this study was to test whether a message that was tailored to AI cultural values associated with the sacredness of traditional tobacco can change variables that behavioral theories have identified as predictors of smoking (i.e., instrumental and experiential attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, perceived capacity and autonomy, and intention with respect to smoking). We conducted a randomized field experiment among 300 never-smoking and ever-smoking urban AI youth in Minneapolis-Saint Paul between May 18 and July 27, 2019. We used a 3 (message condition: cultural benefits of not smoking cigarettes, health benefits of not smoking cigarettes, comparison message about benefits of healthy eating) × 2 (smoking status: ever-smoked, never-smoked) between-subjects design. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that for ever-smokers, the cultural consequences of smoking message significantly lowered instrumental attitude (partial eta2 = 0.029), experiential attitude (partial eta2 = 0.041), perceived capacity (partial eta2 = 0.051), and smoking intention (partial eta2 = 0.035) compared to the healthy eating comparison message and the health consequences of smoking message. This was not observed among never-smokers, who already had very negative smoking perceptions. We conclude that messages that tailor to AI culture may be effective tools for discouraging smoking among AI youth.},

	abstract = {Objective
To broadly synthesize literature regarding decision aids (DAs) supporting decision making about diet, physical activity, sleeping and substance use a scoping review was performed.
Methods
Multiple sources were used: (1) Scientific literature searches, (2) excluded references from a Cochrane review regarding DAs for treatments and screenings, and (3) results from additional searches. Interventions had to (1) support informed decision making and (2) provide information and help to choose between at least two options. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts. Relevant information was extracted descriptively.
Results
Thirty-five scientific articles and four DAs (grey literature) were included. Results were heterogeneous. Twenty-nine (94\%) studies described substance use DAs. All DAs offered information and value and/or preference clarification. Many other elements were included (e.g., goal-setting). DA’s effects were mixed. Few studies used standardized measures, e.g., decisional conflict (n = 4, 13\%). Some positive behavioral effects were reported: e.g., smoking abstinence (n = 1).
Conclusions
This research shows only some positive behavioral effects of DAs. However, studies reported heterogeneous results/outcomes, impeding knowledge synthesis. Areas of improvement were identified, e.g., establishing which intervention elements are effective regarding health behavior decision making.
Practice implications
DAs can potentially be beneficial in supporting people to change health behaviors – especially regarding smoking.},

	abstract = {Background: Although effective smoking cessation interventions exist, information is limited about their cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an Internet-based multiple computer-tailored smoking cessation program and tailored counseling by practice nurses working in Dutch general practices compared with an Internet-based multiple computer-tailored program only and care as usual. Methods: The economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial, for which 91 practice nurses recruited 414 eligible smokers. Smokers were randomized to receive multiple tailoring and counseling (n=163), multiple tailoring only (n=132), or usual care (n=119). Self-reported cost and quality of life were assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. Prolonged abstinence and 24-hour and 7-day point prevalence abstinence were assessed at 12-month follow-up. The trial-based economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective. Uncertainty was accounted for by bootstrapping (1000 times) and sensitivity analyses. Results: No significant differences were found between the intervention arms with regard to baseline characteristics or effects on abstinence, quality of life, and addiction level. However, participants in the multiple tailoring and counseling group reported significantly more annual health care–related costs than participants in the usual care group. Cost-effectiveness analysis, using prolonged abstinence as the outcome measure, showed that the mere multiple computer-tailored program had the highest probability of being cost-effective. Compared with usual care, in this group €5100 had to be paid for each additional abstinent participant. With regard to cost-utility analyses, using quality of life as the outcome measure, usual care was probably most efficient. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an Internet-based smoking cessation program with and without counseling by a practice nurse. Although the Internet-based multiple computer-tailored program seemed to be the most cost-effective treatment, the cost-utility was probably highest for care as usual. However, to ease the interpretation of cost-effectiveness results, future research should aim at identifying an acceptable cutoff point for the willingness to pay per abstinent participant.},

Twelve studies reported cost-savings (range=US\$10 to US\$81 156; US dollars in 2020), primarily from the organisational or health system perspective, and 10 studies did not. However, due to the quality of the economic analyses, and the related issues with the interpretative validity of results it would be inappropriate to say that PDAs will generate savings, from any perspective.Conclusions It is unclear whether PDAs will generate savings.

	abstract = {Introduction
Cigarette smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. Smoking also carries an economic burden, including smoking-attributable healthcare spending. This study assessed smoking-attributable fractions in healthcare spending between 2010 and 2014, overall and by insurance type (Medicaid, Medicare, private, out-of-pocket, other federal, other) and by medical service (inpatient, non-inpatient, prescriptions).
Methods
Data were obtained from the 2010–2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to the 2008–2013 National Health Interview Survey. The final sample (n = 49,540) was restricted to non-pregnant adults aged 18 years or older. Estimates from two-part models (multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models) and data from 2014 national health expenditures were combined to estimate the share of and total (in 2014 dollars) annual healthcare spending attributable to cigarette smoking among U.S. adults. All models controlled for socio-demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and attitudes.
Results
During 2010–2014, an estimated 11.7\% (95\% CI = 11.6\%, 11.8\%) of U.S. annual healthcare spending could be attributed to adult cigarette smoking, translating to annual healthcare spending of more than \$225 billion dollars based on total personal healthcare expenditures reported in 2014. More than 50\% of this smoking-attributable spending was funded by Medicare or Medicaid. For Medicaid, the estimated healthcare spending attributable fraction increased more than 30\% between 2010 and 2014.
Conclusions
Cigarette smoking exacts a substantial economic burden in the U.S. Continuing efforts to implement proven population-based interventions have been shown to reduce the health and economic burden of cigarette smoking nationally.},

	abstract = {Background Australian clinicians are advised to ‘offer evidence-based decisional support to men considering whether or not to have a PSA test’. This randomised trial compared the performance and acceptability of two new decision aids (DAs) to aid men in making informed choices about PSA screening. Methods {\textasciitilde}3000 Australian men 45–60 years with varying educational attainment were recruited via an online panel and randomised to view one of two online decision aids (one full length, one abbreviated) and completed a questionnaire. The primary outcome was informed choice about PSA screening. Findings Significantly more men in the long DA group (38\%) made an informed choice than men who received the shorter DA (33\%) (95\% CI 1.1\% to 8.2\%; p = 0.008). On knowledge, the long DA group scored, on average, 0.45 points higher than the short DA group (95\% CI 0.14 to 0.76; p = 0.004) and 5\% more of the participants achieved an adequate knowledge score (95\% CI 1.9\% to 8.8\%; p = 0.002). Men allocated the long DA were less likely to intend to have a PSA test in the future (53\%) than men in the short DA group (59\%). Both DAs rated highly on acceptability. Conclusions Both DAs were useful and acceptable to men regardless of education level and both supported informed decision making. The long version resulted in higher knowledge, and a higher proportion of men able to make an informed choice, but the differences were small. Long DAs may be useful for men whose informational needs are not satisfied by a short DA.},

	doi = {10.11124/JBISRIR-2017-003698},
	abstract = {Objective: 
The objective of the review was to determine the effectiveness of the use of decision aids to facilitate the shared decision-making process between a person and a healthcare provider on smoking cessation rates, knowledge of smoking cessation methods and decisional quality.
Introduction:
The tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest health threats in the world, and it is the single most important preventable cause of disease. In the smoking cessation process, people move through different stages in their readiness to quit. Healthcare providers are well positioned to impact smoking cessation, however, challenges continue to exist. Using decision aids in the smoking cessation decision-making process may be one means in moving people toward the decision to quit smoking.
Inclusion criteria:
The review considered randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies which included adults, 18 years and over, who smoke tobacco products. The intervention of interest was implementation of decision aids to promote shared decision-making related to smoking cessation. The comparator was usual care without the use of decision aids. Outcomes of interest were smoking abstinence, smoking quit attempts, knowledge of smoking cessation methods and decisional quality.
Methods:
A comprehensive search was undertaken to locate relevant published and unpublished quantitative English language studies from the inception of each database searched through July 30, 2017. Databases searched included: CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed. A search of gray literature was also performed. Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers for assessment against the inclusion criteria. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved in full and assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Two reviewers independently evaluated the included studies for methodological quality using critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Data related to the methods, participants, interventions and findings were extracted by two independent reviewers using a standardized data extraction tool from JBI. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity in the interventions and outcome measures of the included studies, statistical meta-analysis was not possible. Results have been presented in narrative form.
Results:
Eight papers representing seven unique studies evaluating smoking cessation decision aids were included. Of the six studies that measured abstinence, only two had positive findings, with one reaching statistical significance. The fours studies that measured quit attempts all demonstrated a trend toward an increase in the number of quit attempts, with one study reaching statistical significance. Four of the five studies that measured knowledge reported an initial increase in the knowledge of smoking cessation methods, with two studies reaching statistical significance. Two of the three studies that measured decisional quality showed an improvement in decisional quality after use of the decision aid, with one study reaching statistical significance.
Conclusions:
The evidence suggests that decision aids may be effective in increasing smoking cessation knowledge and decisional quality while increasing quit attempts. There is, however, inconclusive evidence to support the definitive effectiveness of decision aids for long term and sustained smoking cessation.},

	abstract = {Background: The content of online computer-tailored interventions is often determined to match an individual’s characteristics, beliefs, and behavioral factors. These content-tailored interventions lead to better message processing and a higher likelihood of behavior change such as smoking cessation. However, a meta-analysis of online computer-tailored interventions showed that effect sizes, albeit positive, remain small, suggesting room for improvement. A promising strategy to enhance the effectiveness of online computer-tailored interventions is to tailor the message frame (ie, how a message is communicated) based on the preferred communication style of the user in addition to content-tailoring. One factor that determines an individual’s communication style preference is the need for autonomy; some individuals prefer an autonomy-supportive communication style (offering choice and use of suggestive language), whereas others might prefer a directive communication style, which is replete with imperatives and does not provide choice. Tailoring how messages are presented (eg, based on the need for autonomy) is called message frame-tailoring. Objective: The aim of the present study was to test the effectiveness of message frame-tailoring based on the need for autonomy, in isolation and in combination with content-tailoring, within the context of an online computer-tailored smoking cessation intervention. The primary outcome measure was the 7-day point-prevalence of smoking abstinence. Secondary outcomes were perceived message relevance, self-determined motivation to quit smoking, and sociocognitive beliefs. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a 2 (message frame-tailoring vs no message frame-tailoring) by 2 (content-tailoring vs no content-tailoring) design was conducted among adult smokers intending to quit smoking (N=273). Results: Structural equation modeling revealed that the content-tailored condition increased smoking abstinence rates 1 month after the start of the intervention (beta=.57, P=.02). However, neither message frame-tailoring nor its interaction with content-tailoring significantly predicted smoking abstinence. In our model, message frame-tailoring, content-tailoring, as well as their interaction significantly predicted perceived relevance of the smoking cessation messages, which consequently predicted self-determined motivation. In turn, self-determined motivation positively affected attitudes and self-efficacy for smoking cessation, but only self-efficacy consequently predicted smoking abstinence. Participants in the control condition perceived the highest level of message relevance (mean 4.78, SD 1.27). However, messages that were frame-tailored for individuals with a high need for autonomy in combination with content-tailored messages led to significantly higher levels of perceived message relevance (mean 4.83, SD 1.03) compared to those receiving content-tailored messages only (mean 4.24, SD 1.05, P=.003). Conclusions: Message frame-tailoring based on the need for autonomy seems to be an effective addition to conventional content-tailoring techniques in online smoking cessation interventions for people with a high need for autonomy; however, this is not effective in its current form for people with a low need for autonomy.

The current study aims to assess the feasibility of applying a proposed set of minimum standards (previously developed as part of a possible certification process) to a selection of existing patient decision support interventions. METHODS: A convenience sample of interventions selected from those included in the 2009 Cochrane systematic review of patient decision aids was scored by trained raters using the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) instrument. Scores were then evaluated against the published proposed minimum standards. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of thirty included interventions met all qualifying criteria while only three met the proposed certification criteria. The changes required for an intervention to meet the proposed certification standards were relatively minor. There was considerable variation between raters' mean scores. CONCLUSIONS: Most interventions did not meet the certification criteria due to lack of information on modifiable items such as update policy and funding source. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Specifying minimum standards for patient decision support interventions is a feasible development. However, it remains unclear whether the minimum standards can be applied to interventions designed for use within clinical encounters and to those that target screening and diagnostic tests.},

	abstract = {Background
Smokers increasingly seek alternative interventions to assist in cessation or reduction efforts. Mindfulness meditation, which facilitates detached observation and paying attention to the present moment with openness, curiosity, and acceptance, has recently been studied as a smoking cessation intervention.
Aims
This review synthesizes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mindfulness meditation (MM) interventions for smoking cessation.
Methods
Five electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2016 to identify English-language RCTs evaluating the efficacy and safety of MM interventions for smoking cessation, reduction, or a decrease in nicotine cravings. Two independent reviewers screened literature using predetermined eligibility criteria, abstracted study-level information, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analyses used the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
Findings
Ten RCTs of MM interventions for tobacco use met inclusion criteria. Intervention duration, intensity, and comparison conditions varied considerably. Studies used diverse comparators such as the American Lung Association's Freedom from Smoking (FFS) program, quitline counseling, interactive learning, or treatment as usual (TAU). Only one RCT was rated as good quality and reported power calculations indicating sufficient statistical power. Publication bias was detected. Overall, mindfulness meditation did not have significant effects on abstinence or cigarettes per day, relative to comparator groups. The small number of studies and heterogeneity in interventions, comparators, and outcomes precluded detecting systematic differences between adjunctive and monotherapy interventions. No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
MM did not differ significantly from comparator interventions in their effects on tobacco use. Low-quality evidence, variability in study design among the small number of existing studies, and publication bias suggest that additional, high-quality adequately powered RCTs should be conducted.},

	abstract = {Objective
We aimed to evaluate the effect of a decision aid (DA) with patient narratives on decisional conflict in surgery choice for Japanese women with early-stage breast cancer.
Methods
Two hundred ten women with early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Groups 1 and 2 received standard information and a DA, with or without patient narratives, and Group 3 received standard information (control) before surgery choice. At baseline, post-intervention (Time 2), and 1 month after surgery (Time 3), we evaluated decisional conflict as the primary outcome using a decisional conflict scale (DCS). Sidak corrections for multiple comparisons in analysis of covariate were used to compare Time 2 and Time 3 DCS mean scores between each pair of groups.
Results
At Time 3, decisional conflict was significantly reduced for Group 1 vs control (P=0.021, Cohen’s d =0.26) and Group 2 vs control (P=0.008, Cohen’s d=0.40).
Conclusion
The DAs with and without patient narratives are equivalently effective at reducing postoperative decisional conflict in Japanese women with early-stage breast cancer.
Practice implications
The DAs with and without patient narratives can be used in clinical practice for women with early-stage breast cancer.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the influence of two different recruitment strategies on the reach and effect of a web-based multiple tailored smoking cessation program. From May 2009 until June 2010, Dutch adult smokers were recruited via mass media or general practices. Those who completed the baseline questionnaire were followed up during 6 weeks (two follow-ups). Differences between the two samples were assessed regarding baseline characteristics, retention rates, quit attempts and 24-hour point prevalence abstinence. Smokers recruited via general practices (N = 409) were significantly lower educated, less addicted, more motivated to quit smoking and to maintain non-smoking, more often female and more often suffering from cardiovascular or respiratory diseases than mass media respondents (N = 1154). They showed higher retention rates and were more likely to report a quit attempt (64.3 versus 50.7\%) and abstinence (43.3 versus 33.1\%). More respondents could be recruited via mass media, while general practices respondents showed higher retention rates and were more successful in quitting smoking, though these effects became non-significant when controlling for experimental condition and baseline differences. The choice for a particular recruitment strategy appeared to determine the number and type of smokers recruited and might consequently influence the intervention’s potential public health impact.},

	abstract = {Background: The Internet has become a popular medium for the delivery of tailored healthy lifestyle promoting interventions. The actual reach of Internet-delivered interventions seems, however, lower than expected, and attrition from interventions is generally high. Characteristics of an intervention, such as personally tailored feedback and goal setting, are thought to be among the important factors related to of use of and exposure to interventions. However, there is no systematic overview of which characteristics of Internet-delivered interventions may be related to more exposure. Objective: The present study aims to identify (1) which potentially exposure-promoting methods and strategies are used in existing Internet interventions, (2) which objective outcome measures are used to measure exposure to Internet interventions, and (3) which potentially exposure-promoting methods and strategies are associated with better exposure. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted based on the Cochrane guidelines. Papers published between 1995 and 2009 were searched in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. In total, 64 studies were included that reported objective exposure measures such as completion of an initial visit, number of log-ins, and time spent on the website. Information about intervention-related characteristics (ie, interactive behavior change strategies, interactive elements for fun, peer or counsel support, email/phone contact, and regular updates of the website) that could potentially contribute to better exposure and objective exposure outcomes were abstracted from the studies and qualitative systematic descriptive analyses were performed. Results: The results showed that a large variety of behavior change techniques and other exposure-promoting elements were used in the interventions and that these methods and strategies varied for the various lifestyle behaviors. Feedback, interactive elements, and email/phone contact were used most often. In addition, there was much variety and a lack of consistency in the exposure measures that were reported. Of all the categories of intervention characteristics that may be associated with better exposure, there were indications that peer and counselor support result in a longer website visit and that email/phone contact and updates of the website result in more log-ins. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative systematic review indicate that of all intervention characteristics that could potentially enhance exposure, only peer support, counselor support, email/phone contact with visitors, and updates of the intervention website were related to better exposure. The diversity of intervention methods used and the inconsistency in the report of exposure measures prevented us from drawing firmer conclusions. More research is needed to identify whether other characteristics of Internet interventions are associated with greater exposure.},

	abstract = {Background Patient decision aids should help people make evidence-informed decisions aligned with their values. There is limited guidance about how to achieve such alignment.Purpose To describe the range of values clarification methods available to patient decision aid developers, synthesize evidence regarding their relative merits, and foster collection of evidence by offering researchers a proposed set of outcomes to report when evaluating the effects of values clarification methods.Data Sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHLStudy Selection We included articles that described randomized trials of one or more explicit values clarification methods. From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods.Data Extraction Two independent reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its evaluation.Data Synthesis Compared to control conditions or to implicit values clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-disgruent choices (risk difference -0.04 95\% CI [-0.06 to -0.02], p\&lt;.001) and decisional regret (standardized mean difference -0.20 95\% CI [-0.29 to -0.11], p\&lt;0.001). Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods (Chi-squared(2)=9.25, p=.01). There were no differences between different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (Chi-squared(2)=6.08, p=.05).Limitations Some meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. We grouped values clarification methods into broad categories.Conclusions Current evidence suggests patient decision aids should include an explicit values clarification method. Developers may wish to specifically consider multicriteria decision analysis. Future evaluations of values clarification methods should report their effects on decisional conflict, decisions made, values congruence, and decisional regret.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) FDN-148426 (PI Witteman).

	abstract = {In this study, penalized imputation (PI), a common approach to handle missing smoking status data and sometimes referred to as “missing=smoking,” is compared with other missing data approaches using data from internet-based smoking cessation trials. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) PI leads to more conservative effect estimates than complete observations analysis; and (2) PI and multiple imputation (MI) lead to similar effect estimates under balanced (equal missingness proportions among the trial arms) and unbalanced missingness.First, the outcomes of 22 trials included in a recent Cochrane review on internet-based smoking cessation interventions were reanalyzed using only the complete observations, and after applying PI. Second, in a simulation study outcomes under PI, complete observations analysis, and two types of MI were compared. For this purpose, individual patient data from one of the Cochrane review trials were used. Results of the missing data approaches were compared with reference data without missing observations, upon which balanced and unbalanced missingness scenarios were imposed. In the reanalysis of 22 trials, relative risks ( RR = 1.15 [1.00; 1.33]) after PI were nearly identical to those under complete observations analysis ( RR = 1.14 [0.98; 1.32]). In the simulation study, PI was the only approach that led to deviations from the reference data beyond its 95\% confidence interval. Analyses after PI led to pooled results equivalent to complete observations analyses. PI also led to significant deviations from the reference in the simulation studies. PI biases the reported effects of interventions, favoring the condition with the lowest proportion of missingness. Therefore, more sophisticated missing data approaches than PI should be applied.},

	abstract = {Objectives. We examined associations between health literacy and predictors of smoking cessation among 402 low-socioeconomic status (SES), racially/ethnically diverse smokers.
Methods. Data were collected as part of a larger study evaluating smoking health risk messages. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to examine relations between health literacy and predictors of smoking cessation (i.e., nicotine dependence, smoking outcome expectancies, smoking risk perceptions and knowledge, self-efﬁcacy, intentions to quit or reduce smoking).
Results. Lower health literacy was associated with higher nicotine dependence, more positive and less negative smoking outcome expectancies, less knowledge about smoking health risks, and lower risk perceptions. Associations remained signiﬁcant (P {\textless} .05) after controlling for demographics and SES-related factors.
Conclusions. These results provide the ﬁrst evidence that low health literacy may serve as a critical and independent risk factor for poor cessation outcomes among low-socioeconomic status, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Research is needed to investigate potential mechanisms underlying this relationship. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:e43–e49. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.301062)},

	abstract = {Abs tract Aim: Identification of contributory factors in smoking and gaining insight into the roles played by each of these factors including health literacy (HL) may account for quitting or decreasing the prevalence of smoking. The aim of the current study was to identify the effects caused by different HL levels on smoking. Methods: 347 students inhabiting the dormitories of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences were included in a cross -sectional correlational study. Random cluster sampling was used for the selection of participants. HELIA questionnaire (used for HL measurement in Iranian urban population between 18-65 years of age) and a researchermade questionnaire (for determining the status of smoking in individuals) were used to collect information from the participants. All data were statistically analyzed by SPSS s o ftware. Findings: The mean and standard deviation of HL score was 70.52±14.12 out of 100. The results indicated that among the university students, 59.7\% (201 people) were non -smokers, 23.1\% (78 people) were smokers, and 17.2\% (58 people) had experienced smoking. These findings reveal that HL is significantly correlated with smoking in university students. Also different levels (insufficient, relatively sufficient, and sufficient) of HL show its significant correlation with smoking, meaning that less HL levels are accompanied by a higher chance of smoking. Conclusion: The relatively high prevalence of smoking in university students and the impact of HL on smoking highlight the need to increase the level of HL in university students and develop an efficient tool for measuring smoking literacy in all age groups.},

	abstract = {Within the field of health psychology, there has been an enormous increase in behaviour change interventions that use digital technology. Answering questions and providing tailored feedback based on the answers provided by participants is the key working mechanism when using computer-tailoring in behaviour change interventions. This behaviour change method has proven to be (cost-)effective and results in participants being exposed to material that is tailored to their social-cognitive profile. At the same time, answering questions to assess this profile increases participant burden and might contribute to low levels of engagement - key challenges in digital health. This article provides insight into whether and how routinely collected data and novel self-assessment methods can be used in computer-tailoring to measure psychological constructs and address these key challenges. The examples presented suggest that the development of novel proxy measures for measuring psychological constructs relevant to computer-tailoring is indeed possible. However, the extent to which measures are valid and actually do reduce participant burden, increase engagement and have other potential benefits is speculative and needs further investigation. The recommendations provided for future research and practice are hoped to serve as a stimulance for driving further momentum in this area.},

To study interventions that provide people with information about cancer risk and about screening that is tailored to their personal characteristics. We assess the tailoring characteristics, theory base and effects on risk perception, knowledge and screening behavior of these interventions.
Methods
A systematic literature review in this field was performed. PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched. Forty studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed and a best evidence synthesis conducted for the 28 randomized controlled trials without co-intervention or with similar co-intervention in intervention and control group.
Results
Most included studies evaluated an intervention aiming to promote cancer screening. The majority of articles (30) evaluated information that was tailored based on variables related to behavior change, sometimes combined with cancer risk factors. Ten other articles described an intervention that tailored information based on risk factors only.
Conclusion
Information that was tailored based on behavior change variables increased realistic perception of cancer risks and knowledge of cancer compared to generic information. Also, information tailored to individuals’ risk factors increased realistic risk perception compared to generic information.
Practice implications
To improve cancer risk perception and knowledge health providers could better give patients information about cancer risk and screening that is tailored to their personal characteristics than generic information.},

Baseline data from the 20 U.S. sites in the National Cancer Institute's Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT) were analyzed. We found that women were less likely than men to be heavy smokers and to report that smoking had affected their health, but more likely to report behavior indicating physiological addition (timing of first cigarette). At all smoking levels, women were about twice as likely as men to report feeling pressure to quit, after adjusting for education, income, ethnic group, age, and other factors. The source of pressure, however, was different: more women report pressure from their children, whereas more men report pressure from friends and coworkers. Women were equally likely as men to make quit attempts, after adjusting for other factors, but were less likely to remain abstinent for at least 10 days. Women, regardless of education, ethnicity, and age, reported a greater tendency to ask permission before smoking in non-restricted public places. College-educated men were less likely than men without college education to smoke without asking in non-restricted places, but education did not influence whether women asked permission. For both sexes, smoking level and nicotine dependence were significant predictors of lighting up without asking in public places, after adjustment for other variables. We discuss these findings and their implications for the gender gap in smoking cessation and women's conflicting pressures to stop/continue smoking. Tobacco control efforts are discussed within the context of gender differences in social norms, roles, socialization, and communication cultures.},

The corrected information is provided. It is noted that, in all cases, the statistical conclusions remain the same.] Objective: Health promotion often faces the problem that populations with high behavioral risk profiles respond defensively to health promotion messages by negating risk or reactant behavior. Self-affirmation theory proposes that defensive reactions are an attempt of the self-system to maintain integrity. In this article, we examine whether a self-affirmation manipulation can mitigate defensive responses to personalized visual risk feedback in the skin cancer prevention context (ultraviolet [UV] photography), and whether the effects pertain to individuals with high behavioral risk status (high personal relevance of tanning). Method: We conducted a full-factorial randomized controlled trial (N = 292; age 11–71) following a 2 * 2 design (UV photo yes/no, self-affirmation yes/no). Follow-up period was 2 weeks. Subsequent tanning behavior, sun avoidance intentions, and risk perception. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a three-way interaction between risk feedback, the self-affirmation manipulation, and risk status for the three outcome measures. Follow-up analyses of variance (ANOVAs) indicated that high-risk individuals receiving only the risk feedback intervention reacted defensively and reported higher exposure. A self-affirmation manipulation mitigates this reactance effect both on the level of cognitions and behavior. Conclusion: Self-affirmation has influential implications not only for Social Psychology but also for health prevention measures. The findings support the effectiveness of self-affirmation in reducing reactant and defensive reactions to personalized visual risk feedback. Interactions with health risk status indicate that self-affirmation might increase the effectiveness of health promotion messages in high-risk populations.

	abstract = {Background: Patient information and education, such as decision aids, are gradually moving toward online, computer-based environments. Considerable research has been conducted to guide content and presentation of decision aids. However, given the relatively new shift to computer-based support, little attention has been given to how multimedia and interactivity can improve upon paper-based decision aids. Objective: The first objective of this review was to summarize published literature into a proposed classification of features that have been integrated into computer-based decision aids. Building on this classification, the second objective was to assess whether integration of specific features was associated with higher-quality decision making. Methods: Relevant studies were located by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases. The review identified studies that evaluated computer-based decision aids for adults faced with preference-sensitive medical decisions and reported quality of decision-making outcomes. A thematic synthesis was conducted to develop the classification of features. Subsequently, meta-analyses were conducted based on standardized mean differences (SMD) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported knowledge or decisional conflict. Further subgroup analyses compared pooled SMDs for decision aids that incorporated a specific feature to other computer-based decision aids that did not incorporate the feature, to assess whether specific features improved quality of decision making. Results: Of 3541 unique publications, 58 studies met the target criteria and were included in the thematic synthesis. The synthesis identified six features: content control, tailoring, patient narratives, explicit values clarification, feedback, and social support. A subset of 26 RCTs from the thematic synthesis was used to conduct the meta-analyses. As expected, computer-based decision aids performed better than usual care or alternative aids; however, some features performed better than others. Integration of content control improved quality of decision making (SMD 0.59 vs 0.23 for knowledge; SMD 0.39 vs 0.29 for decisional conflict). In contrast, tailoring reduced quality of decision making (SMD 0.40 vs 0.71 for knowledge; SMD 0.25 vs 0.52 for decisional conflict). Similarly, patient narratives also reduced quality of decision making (SMD 0.43 vs 0.65 for knowledge; SMD 0.17 vs 0.46 for decisional conflict). Results were varied for different types of explicit values clarification, feedback, and social support. Conclusions: Integration of media rich or interactive features into computer-based decision aids can improve quality of preference-sensitive decision making. However, this is an emerging field with limited evidence to guide use. The systematic review and thematic synthesis identified features that have been integrated into available computer-based decision aids, in an effort to facilitate reporting of these features and to promote integration of such features into decision aids. The meta-analyses and associated subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence to support integration of specific features into future decision aids. Further research can focus on clarifying independent contributions of specific features through experimental designs and refining the designs of features to improve effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Shared decision making (SDM) occurs when patients and clinicians work together to reach care decisions that are both medically sound and responsive to patients’ preferences and values. SDM is an important tenet of patient-centered care that can improve patient outcomes. Patients with multiple minority identities, such as sexual orientation and race/ethnicity, are at particular risk for poor SDM. Among these dual-minority patients, added challenges to clear and open communication include cultural barriers, distrust, and a health care provider’s lack of awareness of the patient’s minority sexual orientation or gender identity. However, organizational factors like a culture of inclusion and private space throughout the visit can improve SDM with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (“LGBT”) racial/ethnic minority patients who have faced stigma and discrimination. Most models of shared decision making focus on the patient–provider interaction, but the health care organization’s context is also critical. Context—an organization’s structure and operations—can strongly influence the ability and willingness of patients and clinicians to engage in shared decision making. SDM is most likely to be optimal if organizations transform their contexts and patients and providers improve their communication. Thus, we propose a conceptual model that suggests ways in which organizations can shape their contextual structure and operations to support SDM. The model contains six drivers: workflows, health information technology, organizational structure and culture, resources and clinic environment, training and education, and incentives and disincentives. These drivers work through four mechanisms to impact care: continuity and coordination, the ease of SDM, knowledge and skills, and attitudes and beliefs. These mechanisms can activate clinicians and patients to engage in high-quality SDM. We provide examples of how specific contextual changes could make SDM more effective for LGBT racial/ethnic minority populations, focusing especially on transformations that would establish a safe environment, build trust, and decrease stigma.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess  preliminary outcomes of a computer-based, bilingual smoking cessation decision-aid  to facilitate utilization of resources. METHODS: A computer kiosk with a smoking  cessation decision-aid was integrated at three safety-net clinics and two health  fairs. The kiosk queries participants about smoking behaviors, guides them to set a  quit date and select treatment, provides printed materials, and prompts fax-referral  to quitline. RESULTS: Among the 163 smokers referred to the kiosk, 78.5\%  participated in the study and 30\% completed the kiosk in Spanish. Few had previously  used cessation resources. During completion of the decision-aid, 95.3\% requested  pharmacotherapy, and 70.3\% opted for counseling. Among those reached for two-month  follow-up (69.5\%), 20.2\% reported they had quit smoking. CONCLUSION: Spanish/English  computerized decision aids are feasible and can facilitate the use of effective  treatments for smoking cessation among underserved smokers.},

	abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

We organized data within a user-centered design framework comprising 3 elements in iterative cycles: understanding users, developing/refining prototype, and observing users.ResultsWe included 607 articles describing 325 patient decision aid projects and 65 other personal health tool projects. Fifty percent of patient decision aid projects reported involving users in at least 1 step for understanding users, 35\% in at least 1 step for developing/refining the prototype, and 84\% in at least 1 step for observing users? interaction with the prototype. In comparison, other personal health tool projects reported 91\%, 49\%, and 92\%, respectively.

	abstract = {Objective: Icon arrays have been suggested as a potentially promising format for communicating risks to patients—especially those with low numeracy skills—but experimental studies are lacking. This study investigates whether icon arrays increase accuracy of understanding medical risks, and whether they affect perceived seriousness of risks and helpfulness of treatments. Design: Two experiments were conducted on samples of older adults (n = 59, 62 to 77 years of age) and university students (n = 112, 26 to 35 years of age). Main Outcome Measures: Accuracy of understanding risk reduction; perceived seriousness of risks; perceived helpfulness of treatments. Results: Icon arrays increased accuracy of both low- and high-numeracy people, even when transparent numerical representations were used.

	abstract = {World-wide, shortages of primary care physicians and an increased demand for services have provided the impetus for delivering team-based primary care. The diversity of the primary care workforce is increasing to include a wider range of health professionals such as nurse practitioners, registered nurses and other clinical staff members. Although this development is observed internationally, skill mix in the primary care team and the speed of progress to deliver team-based care differs across countries. This work aims to provide an overview of education, tasks and remuneration of nurses and other primary care team members in six OECD countries. Based on a framework of team organization across the care continuum, six national experts compare skill-mix, education and training, tasks and remuneration of health professionals within primary care teams in the United States, Canada, Australia, England, Germany and the Netherlands. Nurses are the main non-physician health professional working along with doctors in most countries although types and roles in primary care vary considerably between countries. However, the number of allied health professionals and support workers, such as medical assistants, working in primary care is increasing. Shifting from ‘task delegation’ to ‘team care’ is a global trend but limited by traditional role concepts, legal frameworks and reimbursement schemes. In general, remuneration follows the complexity of medical tasks taken over by each profession. Clear definitions of each team-member's role may facilitate optimally shared responsibility for patient care within primary care teams. Skill mix changes in primary care may help to maintain access to primary care and quality of care delivery. Learning from experiences in other countries may inspire policy makers and researchers to work on efficient and effective teams care models worldwide.},

	abstract = {Individuals are increasingly involved in decisions about their health care. Shared decision making (SDM), an intervention in the clinical setting in which patients and providers collaborate in decision making, is an important approach for informing patients and involving them in their health care. However, SDM cannot bear the entire burden for informing and involving individuals. Population-oriented interventions to promote informed decision making (IDM) should also be explored. This review provides a conceptual background for population-oriented interventions to promote informed decisions (IDM interventions), followed by a systematic review of studies of IDM interventions to promote cancer screening. This review specifically asked whether IDM interventions (1) promote understanding of cancer screening, (2) facilitate participation in decision making about cancer screening at a level that is comfortable for individuals; or (3) encourage individuals to make cancer-screening decisions that are consistent with their preferences and values. Fifteen intervention arms met the intervention definition. They used small media, counseling, small-group education, provider-oriented strategies, or combinations of these to promote IDM. The interventions were generally consistent in improving individuals' knowledge about the disease, accuracy of risk perceptions, or knowledge and beliefs about the pros and cons of screening and treatment options. However, few studies evaluated whether these interventions resulted in individuals participating in decision making at a desirable level, or whether they led to decisions that were consistent with individuals' values and preferences. More research is needed on how best to promote and facilitate individuals' participation in health care. Work is especially needed on how to facilitate participation at a level desired by individuals, how to promote decisions by patients that are consistent with their preferences and values, how to perform effective and cost-effective IDM interventions for healthcare systems and providers and in community settings (outside of clinical settings), and how to implement these interventions in diverse populations (such as populations that are older, nonwhite, or disadvantaged). Finally, work is needed on the presence and magnitude of barriers to and harms of IDM interventions and how they might be avoided.},

SuperFIT (Systems of Underprivileged Preschoolers in their home and preschool EnviRonment: Family Intervention Trial) is a comprehensive, integrated intervention approach for 2\&ndash;4 year old children. This paper describes the development and design of the evaluation of SuperFIT. The SuperFIT intervention approach consists of preschool-based, family-based, and community-based components. Intervention activities aimed at changing the physical, sociocultural and political environments in each setting and establishing an increased alignment between the settings. A quasi-experimental design was adopted with twelve intervention and nine control preschools to evaluate effectiveness. The primary outcomes were Body Mass Index (BMI) z-scores (objectively assessed height and weight), dietary intake (24 h recall), and physical activity (accelerometer) of the children. Further, the effects on the nutrition- and physical activity-related practices of preschool teachers and parents were evaluated (questionnaires). Intervention effectiveness was evaluated using linear mixed models. Process evaluation was performed using mixed methods; both quantitative (questionnaires) and qualitative (observations and in-depth interviews) measures were used.

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Schools in many countries undertake programmes for smoking prevention, but systematic reviews have shown mixed evidence of their effectiveness. Most peer-led approaches have been classroom-based, and rigorous assessments are scarce. We assessed the effectiveness of a peer-led intervention that aimed to prevent smoking uptake in secondary schools.
Methods
We undertook a cluster randomised controlled trial of 10 730 students aged 12–13 years in 59 schools in England and Wales. 29 schools (5372 students) were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation to the control group to continue their usual smoking education and 30 (5358 students) to the intervention group. The intervention (ASSIST [A Stop Smoking In Schools Trial] programme) consisted of training influential students to act as peer supporters during informal interactions outside the classroom to encourage their peers not to smoke. Follow-up was immediately after the intervention and at 1 and 2 years. Primary outcomes were smoking in the past week in both the school year group and in a group at high risk of regular smoking uptake, which was identified at baseline as occasional, experimental, or ex-smokers. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN55572965.
Findings
The odds ratio of being a smoker in intervention compared with control schools was 0·75 (95\% CI 0·55–1·01) immediately after the intervention (n=9349 students), 0·77 (0·59–0·99) at 1-year follow-up (n=9147), and 0·85 (0·72–1·01) at 2-year follow-up (n=8756). The corresponding odds ratios for the high-risk group were 0·79 (0·55–1·13 [n=3561]), 0·75 (0·56–0·99 [n=3483]), and 0·85 (0·70–1·02 [n=3294]), respectively. In a three-tier multilevel model with data from all three follow-ups, the odds of being a smoker in intervention compared with control schools was 0·78 (0·64–0·96).
Interpretation
The results suggest that, if implemented on a population basis, the ASSIST intervention could lead to a reduction in adolescent smoking prevalence of public-health importance.

In developed countries as a whole, tobacco was responsible for 24\% of all male deaths and 7\% of all female deaths, rising to over 40\% in men in some former socialist economies and 17\% in women in the USA. The average loss of life for all cigarette smokers was about 8 years and for those whose deaths were attributable to tobacco about 16 years. Trends in mortality attributable to tobacco differed by half in men since 1965; in others it was continuing to increase. In women, the proportion was mostly increasing, almost universally in old age. Mortality not attributable to smoking decreased since 1955 in all OECD (Organization for European Collaboration and Development) countries, by up to 60\% in men and more in women. No precise estimate can be made of the number of deaths attributable to smoking in undeveloped countries, but the prevalence of smoking suggests that it will be large.

We examined the use of the DCS over its initial 20 years (1995 to 2015). Methods. We conducted a scoping review with backward citation search in Google Analytics/Web of Science/PubMed, followed by keyword searches in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, PRO-Quest, and Web of Science. Eligible studies were published between 1995 and March 2015, used an original experimental/observational research design, concerned a health-related decision, and provided DCS data (total/subscales). Author dyads independently screened titles, abstracts, full texts, and extracted data. We performed narrative data synthesis. Results. We included 394 articles. DCS use appeared to increase over time. Three hundred nine studies (76\%) used the original DCS, and 29 (7\%) used subscales only. Most studies used the DCS to evaluate the impact of decision support interventions (n = 238, 59\%). The DCS was translated into 13 languages. Most decisions were made by people for themselves (n = 353, 87\%), about treatment (n = 225, 55\%), or testing (n = 91, 23\%). The most common decision contexts were oncology (n = 113, 28\%) and primary care (n = 82, 20\%). Conclusions. This is the first study to descriptively synthesize characteristics of DCS data. Use of the DCS as an outcome measure for health decision interventions has increased over its 20-year existence, demonstrating its relevance as a decision-making evaluation measure. Most studies failed to report when decisional conflict was measured during the decision-making process, making scores difficult to interpret.

	abstract = {Objective
Although involving women in breast cancer treatment decisions is advocated, there is little understanding of whether women have the information they need to make informed decisions. The objective of the current study was to evaluate women's knowledge of survival and recurrence rates for mastectomy and breast conserving surgery (BCS) and the factors associated with this knowledge.
Methods
We used a population-based sample of women diagnosed with breast cancer in metropolitan Los Angeles and Detroit between December 2001 and January 2003. All women with ductal carcinoma in situ and a random sample of women with invasive disease were selected (N=2382), of which 1844 participated (77.4\%). All participants were mailed surveys. The main outcome measures were knowledge of survival and recurrence rates by surgical treatment type.
Results
Only 16\% of women knew that recurrence rates were different for mastectomy and BCS, and 48\% knew that the survival rates were equivalent across treatment. Knowledge about survival and recurrence was improved by exposure to the Internet and health pamphlets (p{\textless}0.01). Women who had a female (versus male) surgeon, and/or a surgeon who explained both treatments (rather than just one treatment) demonstrated higher survival knowledge (p{\textless}0.01). The majority of women had inadequate knowledge with which to make informed decisions about breast cancer surgical treatment.
Conclusion
Previous explanations for poor knowledge, such as irrelevance of knowledge to decision making and lack of access to information, were not shown to be plausible explanations for the low levels of knowledge observed in this sample.
Practice implications
These results suggest a need for fundamental changes in patient education to ensure that women are able to make informed decisions about their breast cancer treatment. These changes may include an increase in the use of decision aids and in decreasing the speed at which treatment decisions are made.},

	abstract = {Abstract Interest in informed decision making (IDM) has grown in recent years. Greater patient involvement in decision making is consistent with recommendations to improve health care quality. This report provides an overview of IDM; clarifies the differences between IDM, shared decision making (SDM), and informed consent; and reviews the evidence to date about IDM for cancer screening. The authors also make recommendations for research. We define IDM as occurring when an individual understands the disease or condition being addressed and comprehends what the clinical service involves, including its benefits, risks, limitations, alternatives, and uncertainties; has considered his or her preferences and makes a decision consistent with them; and believes he or she has participated in decision making at the level desired. IDM interventions are used to facilitate informed decisions. The authors reviewed the evidence to date for IDM and cancer screening based primarily on published meta-analyses and a recent report for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guide to Community Preventive Services. IDM and SDM interventions, such as decision aids, result in improved knowledge, beliefs, risk perceptions, and combinations of these. Little or no evidence exists, however, regarding whether these interventions result in 1) participation in decision making at a level consistent with patient preferences or 2) effects on patient satisfaction with the decision-making process. These variables generally either were not assessed or were not reported in the articles reviewed. Results of interventions on uptake of screening were variable. After exposure to IDM/SDM interventions, most studies showed small decreases in prostate cancer screening, whereas four studies on breast and colorectal cancer screening showed small increases. Few data are available by which to evaluate current practices in cancer screening IDM. Patient participation in IDM should be facilitated for those who prefer it. More research is needed to assess the benefits of IDM/SDM interventions and to tailor interventions to individuals who are most likely to desire and benefit from them. There are many system barriers to IDM/SDM and few tools. More work is needed in this area as well. In addition, research is needed to learn how to incorporate IDM into ongoing clinical practice and to determine whether there are unintended negative consequences of IDM.

Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

A vast majority (89\%) of respondents preferred to review medical student transcripts that use grades rather than pass/fail evaluations. In addition, 83\% would prefer to evaluate their own students with a grading system rather than a pass/fail mark. Eighty-one percent of program directors believed that the medical student's ability to compete for a residency position was adversely influenced by the pass/fail method of evaluation. Since program directors appear to be biased in favor of an evaluation system that provides them with more objective data, we conclude that the use of the pass/fail grading system puts the medical student at a disadvantage in competing for general surgery residency positions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background? Although an increasing number of decision support interventions for patients (including decision aids) are produced, few make explicit use of theory. We argue the importance of using theory to guide design. The aim of this work was to address this theory?practice gap and to examine how a range of selected decision-making theories could inform the design and evaluation of decision support interventions. Methods? We reviewed the decision-making literature and selected relevant theories. We assessed their key principles, theoretical pathways and predictions in order to determine how they could inform the design of two core components of decision support interventions, namely, information and deliberation components and to specify theory-based outcome measures. Results? Eight theories were selected: (1) the expected utility theory; (2) the conflict model of decision making; (3) prospect theory; (4) fuzzy-trace theory; (5) the differentiation and consolidation theory; (6) the ecological rationality theory; (7) the rational?emotional model of decision avoidance; and finally, (8) the Attend, React, Explain, Adapt model of affective forecasting. Some theories have strong relevance to the information design (e.g. prospect theory); some are more relevant to deliberation processes (conflict theory, differentiation theory and ecological validity). None of the theories in isolation was sufficient to inform the design of all the necessary components of decision support interventions. It was also clear that most work in theory-building has focused on explaining or describing how humans think rather than on how tools could be designed to help humans make good decisions. It is not surprising therefore that a large theory?practice gap exists as we consider decision support for patients. There was no relevant theory that integrated all the necessary contributions to the task of making good decisions in collaborative interactions. Discussion? Initiatives such as the International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration influence standards for the design of decision support interventions. However, this analysis points to the need to undertake more work in providing theoretical foundations for these interventions.},

METHODS: A 5-item scale was administered to 4 patient groups making different health care decisions. Convergent validity was determined by examining the scale's correlation with satisfaction measures, decisional conflict, and health outcome measures. RESULTS: The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81 to 0.92). It correlated strongly with decision satisfaction (r = -0.40 to -0.60), decisional conflict (r = 0.31 to 0.52), and overall rated quality of life (r = -0.25 to -0.27). Groups differing on feelings about a decision also differed on rated regret: F(2, 190) = 31.1, P {\textless} 0.001. Regret was greater among those who changed their decisions than those who did not, t(175) = 16.11, P {\textless} 0.001.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the scale's psychometric properties. METHODS: From July 2005 to March 2006, after viewing a decision aid prescribed during routine clinical care, patients completed a questionnaire including: demographic information, treatment intention, decisional conflict, decision aid acceptability, and the PrepDM scale. RESULTS: Four hundred orthopaedic patients completed the questionnaire. The PrepDM scale showed significant correlation with the informed (r=-0.21, p{\textless}0.01) and support (r=-0.13, p=0.01) subscales (DCS); and discriminated significantly between patients who did and did not find the decision aid helpful (p{\textless}0.0001). Alpha coefficients for internal consistency ranged from 0.92 to 0.96. The scale is strongly unidimensional (principal components analysis) and Item Response Theory analyses demonstrated that all ten scale items function very well. CONCLUSION: The psychometric properties of the PrepDM scale are very good. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The scale could allow more comprehensive evaluation of interventions designed to prepare patients for shared-decision making encounters regarding complex health care decisions.},

One factor that may be affecting the psychometric qualities of the scale is the use of a dichotomous, forced-choice response format for certain items, in which respondents are asked to answer each question with a Yes or No response. This scoring approach is especially problematic when used to measure dimensional constructs, such as nicotine dependence, in which a dimensional construct is forced into a categorical construct. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether revising the response format utilized in the FTND would lead to an enhancement in the psychometric properties of this scale. This question was examined by removing the forced-choice response criteria on items 2, 5, and 6 of the FTND and revising the response options to reflect a 4-point Likert response set (0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = most of the time, 3 = always). Participants consisted of 343 smokers from the community. Results revealed that the revised scoring approach resulted in a significant incremental improvement in scale reliability and enhanced convergent validity, showing a stronger association with smoking outcomes than the FTQ or FTND. Findings are discussed in terms of recommendations for scale revision and usage.},

	abstract = {Background: Web-based health behavior change interventions may be more effective if they offer autonomy-supportive communication facilitating the internalization of motivation for health behavior change. Yet, at this moment no validated tools exist to assess user-perceived autonomy-support of such interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate the virtual climate care questionnaire (VCCQ), a measure of perceived autonomy-support in a virtual care setting. Methods: Items were developed based on existing questionnaires and expert consultation and were pretested among experts and target populations. The virtual climate care questionnaire was administered in relation to Web-based interventions aimed at reducing consumption of alcohol (Study 1; N=230) or cannabis (Study 2; N=228). Item properties, structural validity, and reliability were examined with item-response and classical test theory methods, and convergent and divergent validity via correlations with relevant concepts. Results: In Study 1, 20 of 23 items formed a one-dimensional scale (alpha=.97; omega=.97; H=.66; mean 4.9 [SD 1.0]; range 1-7) that met the assumptions of monotonicity and invariant item ordering. In Study 2, 16 items fitted these criteria (alpha=.92; H=.45; omega=.93; mean 4.2 [SD 1.1]; range 1-7). Only 15 items remained in the questionnaire in both studies, thus we proceeded to the analyses of the questionnaire?s reliability and construct validity with a 15-item version of the virtual climate care questionnaire. Convergent validity of the resulting 15-item virtual climate care questionnaire was confirmed by positive associations with autonomous motivation (Study 1: r=.66, P{\textless}.001; Study 2: r=.37, P{\textless}.001) and perceived competence for reducing alcohol intake (Study 1: r=.52, P{\textless}.001). Divergent validity could only be confirmed by the nonsignificant association with perceived competence for learning (Study 2: r=.05, P=.48). Conclusions: The virtual climate care questionnaire accurately assessed participants? perceived autonomy-support offered by two Web-based health behavior change interventions. Overall, the scale showed the expected properties and relationships with relevant concepts, and the studies presented suggest this first version of the virtual climate care questionnaire to be reasonably valid and reliable. As a result, the current version may cautiously be used in future research and practice to measure perceived support for autonomy within a virtual care climate. Future research efforts are required that focus on further investigating the virtual climate care questionnaire's divergent validity, on determining the virtual climate care questionnaire?s validity and reliability when used in the context of Web-based interventions aimed at improving nonaddictive or other health behaviors, and on developing and validating a short form virtual climate care questionnaire.},

	abstract = {Background: Web-based and mobile health interventions (also called “Internet interventions” or "eHealth/mHealth interventions") are tools or treatments, typically behaviorally based, that are operationalized and transformed for delivery via the Internet or mobile platforms. These include electronic tools for patients, informal caregivers, healthy consumers, and health care providers. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was developed to improve the suboptimal reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While the CONSORT statement can be applied to provide broad guidance on how eHealth and mHealth trials should be reported, RCTs of web-based interventions pose very specific issues and challenges, in particular related to reporting sufficient details of the intervention to allow replication and theory-building. Objective: To develop a checklist, dubbed CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth), as an extension of the CONSORT statement that provides guidance for authors of eHealth and mHealth interventions. Methods: A literature review was conducted, followed by a survey among eHealth experts and a workshop. Results: A checklist instrument was constructed as an extension of the CONSORT statement. The instrument has been adopted by the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) and authors of eHealth RCTs are required to submit an electronic checklist explaining how they addressed each subitem. Conclusions: CONSORT-EHEALTH has the potential to improve reporting and provides a basis for evaluating the validity and applicability of eHealth trials. Subitems describing how the intervention should be reported can also be used for non-RCT evaluation reports. As part of the development process, an evaluation component is essential; therefore, feedback from authors will be solicited, and a before-after study will evaluate whether reporting has been improved.},

	abstract = {Background: Health care is increasingly featured by the use of Web 2.0 communication and collaborative technologies that are reshaping the way patients and professionals interact. These technologies or tools can be used for a variety of purposes: to instantly debate issues, discover news, analyze research, network with peers, crowd-source information, seek support, and provide advice. Not all tools are implemented successfully; in many cases, the nonusage attrition rates are high. Little is known about the preferences of the Dutch general population regarding the use of the Internet and social media in health care. Objective: To determine the preferences of the general population in the Netherlands regarding the use of the Internet and social media in health care. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was disseminated via a popular Dutch online social network. Respondents were asked where they searched for health-related information, how they qualified the value of different sources, and their preferences regarding online communication with health care providers. Results were weighed for the Dutch population based on gender, age, and level of education using official statistics. Numbers and percentages or means and standard deviations were presented for different subgroups. One-way ANOVA was used to test for statistical differences. Results: The survey was completed by 635 respondents. The Internet was found to be the number one source for health-related information (82.7\%), closely followed by information provided by health care professionals (71.1\%). Approximately one-third (32.3\%) of the Dutch population search for ratings of health care providers. The most popular information topics were side effects of medication (62.5\%) and symptoms (59.7\%). Approximately one-quarter of the Dutch population prefer to communicate with a health care provider via social media (25.4\%), and 21.2\% would like to communicate via a webcam. Conclusions: The Internet is the main source of health-related information for the Dutch population. One in 4 persons wants to communicate with their physician via social media channels and it is expected that this number will further increase. Health care providers should explore new ways of communicating online and should facilitate ways for patients to connect with them. Future research should aim at comparing different patient groups and diseases, describing best practices, and determining cost-effectiveness.},

To increase the usefulness and effectiveness of decision aids, it is important to involve end-users in the development of these tools. This article reports on the development of an online contraceptive decision aid.Methods:An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted in the Netherlands between 2014 and 2016. The development process of the decision aid consisted of six steps and included a needs assessment and field test. Interviews were conducted with 17 female students.Results:The needs assessment provided information on the preferred content and structure of a contraceptive decision aid and guided the development of the online contraceptive decision aid prototype. Participants had an overall positive impression of the decision aid prototype during the field test. Minor revisions were made based on participants? feedback. Participants expected that the decision aid would positively contribute to decision making by increasing knowledge and awareness regarding the available contraceptive methods and their features and attributes, and by opening up to other options than the known methods.Conclusion:The developed contraceptive decision aid can contribute to better informed decision making and consultation preparation. Involving end-users in development seems valuable to adapt decision aids to specific needs and to identify in what way a decision aid influences decision making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals frequently advise people to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation, and to determine the effect of anti-smoking advice on disease-specific and all-cause mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in January 2013 for trials of interventions involving physicians. We also searched Latin American databases through BVS (Virtual Library in Health) in February 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomisation and completeness of follow-up.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We also considered the effect of advice on mortality where long-term follow-up data were available. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. People lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Effects were expressed as relative risks. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 42 trials, conducted between 1972 and 2012, including over 31,000 smokers. In some trials, participants were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. Other settings included hospital wards and outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics.Pooled data from 17 trials of brief advice versus no advice (or usual care) detected a significant increase in the rate of quitting (relative risk (RR) 1.66, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 1.94). Amongst 11 trials where the intervention was judged to be more intensive the estimated effect was higher (RR 1.84, 95\% CI 1.60 to 2.13) but there was no statistical difference between the intensive and minimal subgroups. Direct comparison of intensive versus minimal advice showed a small advantage of intensive advice (RR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.56). Direct comparison also suggested a small benefit of follow-up visits. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. This study found no statistically significant differences in death rates at 20 years follow-up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3\%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3\%. Additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.},

	isbn = {978-1-59385-836-0 (Hardcover)},
	abstract = {Although it is not always reflected in the discourse of contemporary psychology, the most proximal determinants of human behavior lie in experience. It is the manner in which people interpret events and the perceived relations of those events to the actors' psychological needs that provide the regnant causes of intentional actions (Ryan \& Deci, 2004). In sum, it is typically people's feelings, beliefs, motives, and goals, and the perceived environment within which these feelings, beliefs, motives, and goals arise, that organize subsequent behavior. Yet oddly empirical psychology today still often finds suspect, or actively discounts, the importance of "subjective" phenomenon, when it is precisely subjective phenomenon that the discipline of psychology ought to lawfully explain. Self determination theory (SDT) has at its core the concept of basic, universal psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Unlike most other theories that use the concept of psychological needs to assess individual differences in motive strength, SDT proposes that these basic needs represent the necessary nutriments for healthy, full functioning. Thus, SDT specifies that these needs must be satisfied for individuals to experience optimal psychological development, performance, and well-being within any domain and across cultural contexts. As it has developed, SDT has used the concept of basic psychological needs to integrate a wide range of phenomena that have been encompassed by SDT's four mini-theories; namely, cognitive evaluation theory, organismic integration theory, causality orientations theory, and basic psychological needs theory. Moreover, the concept of basic psychological needs has been useful in extending SDT to a variety of new research areas, including subjective energy, mindfulness, and close relationships. Finally, the concept of needs has proven to be practically useful, as shown by SDT's applications in far-ranging domains: education, parenting, work, medicine, sport and exercise, politics, aging, and psychotherapy. SDT, in short, has aimed at providing a fuller understanding of what it is that people truly need for optimal living, and all that distracts from, or undermines, those needs being fulfilled.

The greatest challenge perhaps is to come up with a questionnaire that is psychometrically sound, and is efficient and effective for use in research and clinical settings. This article provides guidelines for the development and translation of questionnaires for application in medical fields, with a special emphasis on perioperative and pain medicine. We provide a framework to guide researchers through the various stages of questionnaire development and translation. To ensure that the questionnaires are psychometrically sound, we present a number of statistical methods to assess the reliability and validity of the questionnaires.},

	abstract = {Early attrition from substance abuse treatment is very high, although rates do not differ dramatically from those found in medical and psychiatric treatments. The consequences of substance abuse treatment dropout are severe, however, with early dropouts having the same outcome as untreated clients. Evidence is considered regarding the impact of demographic and social variables on continuation in treatment. The effects of client motivation, substance use, criminality and legal pressure, prior treatment history, and psychopathology are also examined. An analysis of treatment factors and procedures used to enhance retention indicates that more conveniently located, smaller, decentralized clinics, with higher clinical staff ratios and more per capita expenditures, have lower attrition rates. Clients are also likely to continue in treatment longer when they receive rapid initial response and individual attention, and when they are seen in smaller groups in friendly, comfortable environments. Inexpensive techniques such as reminder phone calls and personal letters can be employed in the absence of resources needed to mount more extensive attrition prevention interventions.},

SETTING: Thoracic surgery clinic in a university hospital cancer center in central  Virginia. SAMPLE: 8 dyads, consisting of 16 total participants. METHODS: A  multidisciplinary, multicomponent smoking cessation intervention incorporated a  theory-based decision aid. Enrollment occurred preoperatively; four face-to-face  visits and an exit interview were conducted during six months. MAIN RESEARCH  VARIABLES: Feasibility was evaluated based on four criteria: recruitment, retention,  adherence, and acceptability. FINDINGS: The recruitment rate was 44\%, and the  retention rate was 100\%. Adherence to the intervention and the acceptability of the  decision aid were greater for patients than family members. Patients had greater  abstinence than family members before surgery and at six months. Exit interview  themes included (a) preoperative timing was acceptable and (b) involving household  members who smoke was important. CONCLUSIONS: Recruiting male patients and their  female partners is feasible. Participants liked convenience, autonomy, and a family  approach. Family members wanted more control over cessation timing and a more  intensive approach to weight and mental health management. Successful dyads worked  together to maintain abstinence. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Oncology nurses can  assess patients' and family members' smoking status, facilitate understanding about  specific benefits of smoking cessation and the obstacle posed by household smokers,  and make referrals to expert resources. Encouraging smoke-free environments is an  important step toward reducing secondhand smoke exposure and promoting cessation.},

	abstract = {Objective
Assessment of patients’ responsiveness to a decision support tool for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The booklet focuses on barriers at patient level.
Methods
Process evaluation of an intervention in primary care. Patients at high or potentially high-cardiovascular risk were asked by their GP to prepare themselves for a second consultation in order to participate in decisions on risk management.
Outcomes
Patients’ actually having read the booklet and returning for the second consultation; comprehension and perceived relevance of the information; perceived reassurance.
Results
17 GPs, in the intervention arm of a cluster RCT, issued 276 decision support tools during the first consultation and were instructed to ask them to return for a second consultation to discuss their CVD risk. Patients had a mean age of 54 years, 47\% were male and 19\% actually had a high cardiovascular risk. Data on 239 patients, a mixture of returnees and non-returnees, showed that they all read the booklet; comprehension was fair to good; 85\% perceived the information as relevant; 68\% of the patients felt reassured by the information. Satisfaction with the first consultation was higher in the non-returnees.
Conclusions
Cardiovascular prevention spread over two consultations with use of a decision support tool for patients is not easily applicable for GPs. However, based on the findings of good patients’ responsiveness, we recommend further development and implementation of decision support tools in primary care.
Practice implications
Decision support for primary CV-prevention is welcomed by patients but needs further adjustment of both the GP and the organization of CV-prevention in primary care. Sharing information between professional and patient on a personal CV-risk management plan is difficult, more training is needed.},

METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science updated on 20 February 2014 were searched for eligible publications. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eleven published articles were included, involving 197,906 participants for short sleep duration and 164,016 participants for long sleep duration. Compared with the normal sleep duration, the pooled OR for obesity was 1.45 (95\% CI, 1.25-1.67) for the short sleep duration overall. After removing the three studies that had strong effects on heterogeneity, the pooled OR was 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.38). The positive association was consistent among all subgroups analysis except in the European group (OR, 1.45; 95\% CI, 0.79-2.64). No significant association was found between long sleep duration and risk of obesity overall (OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.15) and in subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that short sleep duration was significantly associated with incidence of obesity, whereas long sleep duration had no effect on future obesity among adults.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.
Methods
We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors—the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
Findings
Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8\% (95\% CI 56·6–58·8) of global deaths and 41·2\% (39·8–42·8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high BMI (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
Interpretation
Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.

This scoping review of systematic reviews aimed to evaluate the current level of evidence in this growing field. Seven electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews published until October 27, 2019. The systematic reviews must have included adult participants only and have evaluated eHealth behavioral interventions with the primary aim of changing nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary behavior or treating or preventing overweight and obesity. One hundred and six systematic reviews, published from 2006 to 2019, were included. Almost all (n?=?98) reviews evaluated the efficacy of interventions. Over half (n?=?61) included interventions focused on physical activity, followed by treatment of obesity (n?=?28), nutrition (n?=?22), prevention of obesity (n?=?18), and sedentary behavior (n?=?6). Many reviews (n?=?46) evaluated one type of eHealth intervention only, while 60 included two or more types. Most reviews (n?=?67) were rated as being of critically low methodological quality. This scoping review identified an increasing volume of systematic reviews evaluating eHealth interventions. It highlights several evidence gaps (e.g., evaluation of other outcomes, such as reach, engagement, or cost effectiveness), guiding future research efforts in this area.},

	abstract = {People make numerous health-related choices each day: For example, deciding to brush one’s teeth or to eat well and healthy – or not to do these activities. To support complex decisions and subsequent behaviour change, both Behaviour Change Interventions (BCIs) and Patient Decision Aids (PtDAs) have been developed and evolved independently to support people in health-related decision making. In this paper, we critically review BCIs and PtDAs, examine their similarities and differences, and identify potential for integration of expertise to increase the benefits for people engaging with healthcare and health behaviours. The two approaches appear to mainly differ in terms of their (1) goals and foci, (2) theoretical basis, (3) development frameworks, (4) active ingredients and (5) effect evaluation. To facilitate the integration of scientific insights from these two fields, we recommend to (1) bring both fields together and promote interprofessional discussions, (2) train (health) professionals to recognise strengths of both approaches, (3) investigate the synergy of the two fields, (4) be prepared for and try to mitigate a culture shock when the fields start to interact. Knowledge generated by researching PtDAs could be used to facilitate decisional processes that enable patients to choose goals that are in line with their values and preferences, while insights from researching BCIs could be used to facilitate engagement with, and implementation of those goals. This integration could allow researchers and intervention providers to increase the benefits for people engaging with healthcare and health behaviours.},

	abstract = {Couples who are at risk of transmitting a genetic disease to their offspring may face difficult challenges regarding reproductive decision-making. Deciding if, and how, to purse their child wish can be a demanding process. This study aims to describe the reproductive joint decision-making process of genetically at-risk couples. A qualitative study was conducted with 16 couples (N=31) at risk of transmitting a genetic disease to their offspring and who received genetic counseling. Most couples were not aware of all available reproductive options in the Netherlands. A variety of motives was reported with almost all couples expressing a preference towards a reproductive option in which the child is genetically related to both parents. Only a few couples considered other options such as the use of donor gametes, adoption, and foster parenting. All couples indicated that they had multiple conversations to reach a mutually supported reproductive decision. Several carriers reported feelings of guilt and in some couples, the woman appeared to have a greater impact in the decision-making process as she should carry a pregnancy and should undergo medical treatments. This study provides insight in the extensive decision-making process of genetically at-risk couples and the role of both partners in this process. These findings can guide the development of genetic counseling (e.g., increase awareness of available reproductive options) and decision support for these couples.},

Low-SES smokers have specific beliefs about smoking and quitting that may serve as barriers to making quit attempts. The purpose of this study was to test the impact of a brief intervention addressing these beliefs on making calls to a telephone quit line.Of 522 smokers entering the study at 5 Wisconsin Salvation Army (SA) sites, 102 expressed motivation to quit and served as a comparison group. The remaining 420 smokers were not motivated to quit and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: an intervention group who received brief counseling focused on cessation goals and beliefs, an attention-control group, and a low contact control group. The primary outcome was the rate at which smokers made a call to the Wisconsin tobacco quit line (WTQL) during their SA visit. Secondary outcome measures included motivational variables, stage of change, changes in beliefs about smoking and quitting, and self-reported abstinence.Unmotivated participants in the intervention condition called the WTQL at a significantly higher rate (12.2\%) than did those in the 2 control conditions (2.2\% and 1.4\%) (p \&lt; .01) and approached the rate of calling by participants who were initially motivated to quit (15.7\%). Intervention condition participants also showed improved motivation to quit and stage of change.A brief, targeted motivational intervention focusing on cessation goals and beliefs increased the initiation of an evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment by low-SES smokers.},

	abstract = {Abstract - Background Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta‐analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost‐effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. Methods This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non‐pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self‐help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta‐analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta‐regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. Main results We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta‐analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high‐certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95\% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95\% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair‐wise meta‐analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair‐wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low‐to very low‐certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Authors' conclusions Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost‐effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed. Plain language summary Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking? Key messages Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. Stopping smoking The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking. Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out: – which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking; – the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and – what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking. We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. Search date:  we included evidence published up to July 2020. What we found We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with: – no behavioural support; – usual or standard care; – less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches. We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. What are the main results of our review? Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. We are uncertain about: – the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and – the effect of who gives the behavioural support. Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. How confident are we in our results? We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract - Background Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. Objectives How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long‐term abstinence (six months or longer)?  How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long‐term abstinence?  How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? Methods The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments.  We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in  The Cochrane Library , for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta‐analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. Main results We identified 12 treatment‐specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95\% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95\% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95\% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head‐to‐head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95\% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95\% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95\% CredI 1.29 to 1.96).  Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95\% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95\% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95\% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95\% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95\% CredI 1.01 to 1.46).  Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95\% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs.  Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta‐analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95\% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95\% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta‐analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95\% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95\% CI 0.62 to 2.56).  Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95\% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95\% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose‐dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. Authors' conclusions NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use.  Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT. Plain language summary Medications to help people to stop smoking: an overview of reviews Background  Smoking is a main cause of early death throughout the world. There are a number of medications which can help people to quit smoking. Three of these, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline, are licensed for this purpose in the USA and Europe. Cytisine (similar to varenicline) is licensed for use in Russia and Eastern Europe. We reviewed studies of these and other treatments, including nortriptyline, to compare their benefits and risks.  Methods  We found 12 Cochrane reviews of different treatments. The treatments include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline); nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine); anxiolytics; selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant); clonidine; lobeline; dianicline; mecamylamine; Nicobrevin; opioid antagonists; nicotine vaccines; and silver acetate. The reviews were conducted between 2008 and 2012, and analysed 267 trials, covering more than 101,000 smokers. All the reviews used randomised controlled trials, and compared the active treatment with a placebo, and sometimes with other treatments. The outcomes were measured at least six months from the start of treatment, and the results were usually checked by testing breath, blood or urine. We also assessed the risk of harms from each treatment. We then compared NRT, bupropion and varenicline with each other, using a network meta‐analysis.  Results  NRT and bupropion helped about 80\% more people to quit than placebo; this means that for every 10 people who quit with placebo about 18 could be expected to quit with NRT or with bupropion. Varenicline more than doubled the chances of quitting compared with placebo, so that for every 10 who quit with placebo about 28 could be expected to quit with varenicline.  Varenicline helped about 50\% more people to quit than nicotine patch and 'other' NRT (tablets, sprays, lozenges and inhalers), and about 70\% more people than nicotine gum. So for every 10 people who quit with NRT patch or with 'other' NRT, about 15 could be expected to quit with varenicline, and for every 10 who quit with NRT gum about 17 could be expected to quit with varenicline. Combining two type of NRT was as effective as using varenicline, and helped more people to quit than single types of NRT. There was little to choose between different types of NRT, apart from 'other' NRT, which helped slightly more people than nicotine gum; for every 10 people who quit with NRT gum, about 12 could be expected to quit with 'other' NRT.  NRT combined with nortriptyline or with bupropion was not more effective than NRT alone.  Both cytisine and nortriptyline compared with placebo improved the chances of quitting, with minimal risk of harms.   Bupropion carries a known risk of seizures (about 1 per 1000 users), but we found fewer than expected in the included and excluded trials, at about 1 in 1500. Although there may be a marginal increase in the likelihood of any serious adverse event while taking bupropion, we did not find increased risks of neuropsychiatric or heart and circulatory problems in the bupropion studies. The evidence for the safety of varenicline is still under investigation; we found no evidence from the trials that it is linked to an increase in neuropsychiatric problems, or with increased heart and circulatory problems.   Clonidine helped people to quit, but caused side effects. It is not clear whether or not mecamylamine used with NRT helps people to quit. Other treatments did not seem to help. So far, nicotine vaccines are not licensed for use anywhere in the world. Nicobrevin is no longer available in the UK, and rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline have all been withdrawn from the market.  Conclusions  NRT, bupropion and varenicline all improve the chances of quitting, with a low risk of harms.  Combination use of NRT is as effective as varenicline, and more effective than single types of NRT.  Cytisine has potential as a safe, effective and affordable treatment.  Nortriptyline improves the chances of quitting, with little evidence of harmful events.  We need continued monitoring of the safety of varenicline.  More research into NRT versus placebo is unlikely to change our understanding of the treatment.},

Decision aids (DAs) facilitate deciding by taking preferences into account. To develop effective DAs, potential end users' (i.e., individuals motivated to quit) needs and experts' viewpoints should be considered. Therefore, the aim of this needs assessment was: (1) To explore end users' needs and (2) to obtain consensus among smoking cessation counsellors and scientific experts to develop a self-administered DA to support end users in choosing cessation assistance. Data was gathered via two approaches: (1) twenty semi-structured interviews with potential end users and (2) two three-round Delphi studies with 61 counsellors and 44 scientific experts. Interview data and the first Delphi rounds were analysed qualitatively, the other Delphi rounds were analysed quantitatively. Potential end users acquired information in different ways, e.g., via own experiences. Important characteristics to decide between tools varied, however effectiveness and costs were commonly reported. Experts reached consensus on 38 and 40 statements, e.g., tools should be appropriate for users' addiction level. Although some trends emerged, due to the variation among stakeholders, a 'one size fits all'-approach is undesirable. This heterogeneity should be considered, e.g., by enabling users to customise the DA.},

Over three-quarters endorsed measuring the following outcomes of decision aids: patients' clarity of trade-offs involved (e.g. survival vs. side effects); comprehension of treatment alternatives, risks and benefits; accuracy of expectations; decision satisfaction; anxiety; commitment to the decision; length of time to complete the decision aid; and decision uncertainty. The least support was for the use of the decision itself as an outcome measure. Conclusions: There is considerable consensus regarding the indications for, content and criteria for evaluating decision aids which should be considered when developing aids relevant to the needs of clinicians and patients.},

	abstract = {Background
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of vaccination decision aids compared with usual care on vaccine uptake, vaccine attitudes, decisional conflict, intent to vaccinate and timeliness.
Methods
Searches were conducted in OVID Medline, OVID Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and SCOPUS. Randomised controlled trials were included if they evaluated the impact of decision aids as defined by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration. Where possible, meta-analysis was undertaken. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we conducted a narrative synthesis. Risk of bias in included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Data were analysed using STATA.
Results
Five RCTs were identified that evaluated the effectiveness of decision aids in the context of vaccination decision making. Meta-analysis of four studies showed that decision aids may have slightly increased vaccination uptake, but this was reduced to no effect once studies with higher risk of bias were excluded. Meta-analysis of three studies showed that decision aids moderately increased intention to vaccinate. Narrative synthesis of two studies suggested that decision aids reduced decisional conflict. One study reported that decision aids decreased perceived risk of vaccination. Content, format and delivery method of the decision aids varied across the studies. It was not clear from the information reported whether these variations affected the effectiveness of the decision aids.
Conclusion
Decision aids can assist in vaccine decision making. Future studies of decision aids could provide greater detail of the decision aids themselves, which would enable comparison of the effectiveness of different elements and formats. Standardising decision aids would also allow for easier comparison between decision aids.},

	abstract = {Background: Tobacco smoking is a worldwide public health problem. In 2015, 26.3\% of the Dutch population aged 18 years and older smoked, 74.4\% of them daily. More and more people have access to the Internet worldwide; approximately 94\% of the Dutch population have online access. Internet-based smoking cessation interventions (online cessation interventions) provide an opportunity to tackle the scourge of tobacco. Objective: The goal of this paper was to provide an overview of online cessation interventions in the Netherlands, while exploring their effectivity, cost effectiveness, and theoretical basis. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used to identify Dutch online cessation interventions, using (1) a scientific literature search, (2) a grey literature search, and (3) expert input. For the scientific literature, the Cochrane review was used and updated by two independent researchers (n=651 identified studies), screening titles, abstracts, and then full-text studies between 2013 and 2016 (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE). For the grey literature, the researchers conducted a Google search (n=100 websites), screening for titles and first pages. Including expert input, this resulted in six interventions identified in the scientific literature and 39 interventions via the grey literature. Extracted data included effectiveness, cost effectiveness, theoretical factors, and behavior change techniques used. Results: Overall, many interventions (45 identified) were offered. Of the 45 that we identified, only six that were included in trials provided data on effectiveness. Four of these were shown to be effective and cost effective. In the scientific literature, 83\% (5/6) of these interventions included changing attitudes, providing social support, increasing self-efficacy, motivating smokers to make concrete action plans to prepare their attempts to quit and to cope with challenges, supporting identity change and advising on changing routines, coping, and medication use. In all, 50\% (3/6) of the interventions included a reward for abstinence. Interventions identified in the grey literature were less consistent, with inclusion of each theoretical factor ranging from 31\% to 67\% and of each behavior change technique ranging from 28\% to 54\%. Conclusions: Although the Internet may provide the opportunity to offer various smoking cessation programs, the user is left bewildered as far as efficacy is concerned, as most of these data are not available nor offered to the smokers. Clear regulations about the effectiveness of these interventions need to be devised to avoid disappointment and failed quitting attempts. Thus, there is a need for policy regulations to regulate the proliferation of these interventions and to foster their quality in the Netherlands.},

	abstract = {Background: Different studies have reported the effectiveness of Web-based computer-tailored lifestyle interventions, but economic evaluations of these interventions are scarce. Objective: The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a sequential and a simultaneous Web-based computer-tailored lifestyle intervention for adults compared to a control group. Methods: The economic evaluation, conducted from a societal perspective, was part of a 2-year randomized controlled trial including 3 study groups. All groups received personalized health risk appraisals based on the guidelines for physical activity, fruit intake, vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Additionally, respondents in the sequential condition received personal advice about one lifestyle behavior in the first year and a second behavior in the second year; respondents in the simultaneous condition received personal advice about all unhealthy behaviors in both years. During a period of 24 months, health care use, medication use, absenteeism from work, and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed every 3 months using Web-based questionnaires. Demographics were assessed at baseline, and lifestyle behaviors were assessed at both baseline and after 24 months. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed based on the outcome measures lifestyle factor (the number of guidelines respondents adhered to) and quality of life, respectively. We accounted for uncertainty by using bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 1733 respondents were included in the analyses. From a willingness to pay of €4594 per additional guideline met, the sequential intervention (n=552) was likely to be the most cost-effective, whereas from a willingness to pay of €10,850, the simultaneous intervention (n=517) was likely to be most cost-effective. The control condition (n=664) appeared to be preferred with regard to quality of life. Conclusions: Both the sequential and the simultaneous lifestyle interventions were likely to be cost-effective when it concerned the lifestyle factor, whereas the control condition was when it concerned quality of life. However, there is no accepted cutoff point for the willingness to pay per gain in lifestyle behaviors, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions. Further economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions are needed.

	abstract = {Worldwide, an increasing number of students in higher education have mental health problems. Talking about these problems at the university is often not that easy. Students fear to be stigmatised if they disclose their problems to others. However, if they do not disclose their problems, they may not get the support they often need. Existing interventions to help people with this disclosure-dilemma are not specifically aimed at students, and lack certain important aspects. Therefore, we developed an intervention to help students with making a personal, well-informed decision regarding whether or not to disclose their problems. We examined the experiences of students and professionals with the new intervention. Moreover, we studied whether the students were less concerned about disclosure and experienced less decisional conflicts after using the intervention. Students with mental health problems from three universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands completed questionnaires prior to the intervention, directly after and three months after. In addition, the educational professionals reported their experiences with applying the intervention. Both students and professionals appreciated the contents and structure of the intervention and students’ level of concern about disclosure and level of decisional conflicts were lower after using the intervention.},

Results There is a paucity of studies reporting relapse curves of self-quitters. The existing eight relapse curves from two studies of self-quitters and five no-treatment control groups indicate most relapse occurs in the first 8 days. These relapse curves were heterogeneous even when the final outcome was made similar. In terms of prolonged abstinence rates, a prior summary of 10 self-quitting studies, two other studies of self-quitters and three no-treatment control groups indicate 3–5\% of self-quitters achieve prolonged abstinence for 6–12 month after a given quit attempt. Conclusions More reports of relapse curves of self-quitters are needed. Smoking cessation interventions should focus on the first week of abstinence. Interventions that produce abstinence rates of 5–10\% may be effective. Cessation studies should report relapse curves.},

	abstract = {Smoking cessation treatment is now integrated into many health-care systems and a major research effort is under way to improve current success rates. Until now results from randomized clinical trials have been reported in many different ways, leading to problems of interpretation. We propose six standard criteria comprising the ‘Russell Standard’ (RS). These criteria are applicable to trials of cessation aids where participants have a defined target quit date and there is face-to-face contact with researchers or clinic staff, as follows. (1) Follow-up for 6 months (RS6) or 12 months (RS12) from the target quit date or the end of a predefined ‘grace period’; (2) self-report of smoking abstinence over the whole follow-up period allowing up to five cigarettes in total; (3) biochemical verification of abstinence at least at the 6-month or 12-month follow-up point; (4) use of an ‘intention-to-treat’ approach in which data from all randomized smokers are included in the analysis unless they have died or moved to an untraceable address (participants who are included in the analysis are counted as smokers if their smoking status at the final follow-up cannot be determined); (5) following-up ‘protocol violators’ and using their true smoking status in the analysis; and (6) collecting follow-up data blind to smokers’ allocation to trial group. We believe that these criteria provide the best compromise between practicability and surrogacy for long-term cessation and will enable meaningful comparison between studies. There may be good reasons why other outcome criteria would also be reported, and studies that involve interventions with special groups or where there is no designated target quit date or face to face contact would need to adapt these criteria accordingly.},

	abstract = {With the current increase in web-based interventions, the question of how to measure, and consequently improve engagement in such interventions is gaining more importance. Modern day web analytics tools make it easy to monitor use of web-based interventions. However, in this article, we propose that it would be more meaningful to first examine how the developers envisioned the use of the intervention to establish behavior change (i.e. intended use), before looking into how the intervention is ultimately used with web analytics (i.e. actual use). Such an approach responds to the regularly expressed concern that behavioral interventions are often poorly described, leading to less meaningful evaluations as it is not clear what exactly is being evaluated. Using a page on chlamydia prevention (104 557 pageviews in 2020) from a Dutch sexual health intervention (Sense), we demonstrate the value of acyclic behavior change diagrams (ABCDs) as a method to visualize intended use of an intervention. ABCDs show at a glance how behavior change principles are applied in an intervention and target determinants of behavior. Based on this ABCD, we investigate actual use of the intervention, using web analytics tool Matomo. Despite being intended to stimulate STI-testing, only 14\% of the 35 347 transfers from this page led to the STI-testing page and a high bounce rate (79\%) and relatively high exit rate were reported (69\%). Recommendations to further interpret the data are given. This real-life example demonstrates the potential of combining ABCDs and Matomo as methods to gain insight into use of web-based interventions.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Web-based smoking interventions hold potential for smoking cessation; however, many of them report low intervention usage (i.e., high levels of non-usage attrition). One strategy to counter this issue is to tailor such interventions to user subtypes if these can be identified and related to non-usage attrition outcomes. The aim of this study was two-fold: (1) to identify and describe a smoker typology in participants of a web-based smoking cessation program and (2) to explore subtypes of smokers who are at a higher risk for non-usage attrition (i.e., early dropout times).
Methods
We conducted secondary analyses of data from a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigated effects of a web-based Cognitive Bias Modification intervention in adult smokers. First, we conducted a two-step cluster analysis to identify subtypes of smokers based on participants' baseline characteristics (including demographics, psychological and smoking-related variables, N = 749). Next, we conducted a discrete-time survival analysis to investigate the predictive value of the subtypes on time until dropout.
Results
We found three distinct clusters of smokers: Cluster 1 (25.2\%, n = 189) was characterized by participants being relatively young, highly educated, unmarried, light-to-moderate smokers, poly-substance users, and relatively high scores on sensation seeking and impulsivity; Cluster 2 (41.0\%, n = 307) was characterized by participants being older, with a relatively high socio-economic status (SES), moderate-to-heavy smokers and regular drinkers; Cluster 3 (33.8\%, n = 253) contained mostly females of older age, and participants were further characterized by a relatively low SES, heavy smoking, and relatively high scores on hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, depression, and alcohol use. Additionally, Cluster 1 was more likely to drop out at the early stage of the intervention compared to Cluster 2 (adjusted Hazard Ratio (HRadjusted) = 1.51, 95\% CI = [1.25, 1.83]) and Cluster 3 (HRadjusted = 1.52, 95\% CI = [1.25, 1.86]).
Conclusions
We identified three clusters of smokers that differed on a broad range of characteristics and on intervention non-usage attrition patterns. This highlights the heterogeneity of participants in a web-based smoking cessation program. Also, it supports the idea that such interventions could be tailored to these subtypes to prevent non-usage attrition. The subtypes of smokers identified in this study need to be replicated in the field of e-health outside the context of RCT; based on the smoker subtypes identified in this study, we provided suggestions for developing tailored web-based smoking cessation intervention programs in future research.},

We found three distinct clusters of smokers: Cluster 1 (25.2\%, n = 189) was characterized by participants being relatively young, highly educated, unmarried, light-to-moderate smokers, poly-substance users, and relatively high scores on sensation seeking and impulsivity; Cluster 2 (41.0\%, n = 307) was characterized by participants being older, with a relatively high socio-economic status (SES), moderate-to-heavy smokers and regular drinkers; Cluster 3 (33.8\%, n = 253) contained mostly females of older age, and participants were further characterized by a relatively low SES, heavy smoking, and relatively high scores on hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, depression, and alcohol use. Additionally, Cluster 1 was more likely to drop out at the early stage of the intervention compared to Cluster 2 (adjusted Hazard Ratio (HRadjusted) = 1.51, 95\% CI = [1.25, 1.83]) and Cluster 3 (HRadjusted = 1.52, 95\% CI = [1.25, 1.86]).
Conclusions
We identified three clusters of smokers that differed on a broad range of characteristics and on intervention non-usage attrition patterns. This highlights the heterogeneity of participants in a web-based smoking cessation program. Also, it supports the idea that such interventions could be tailored to these subtypes to prevent non-usage attrition. The subtypes of smokers identified in this study need to be replicated in the field of e-health outside the context of RCT; based on the smoker subtypes identified in this study, we provided suggestions for developing tailored web-based smoking cessation intervention programs in future research.},

	abstract = {This paper is one in a series developed through a process of expert consensus to provide an overview of questions of current importance in research into engagement with digital behavior change interventions, identifying guidance based on research to date and priority topics for future research. The first part of this paper critically reflects on current approaches to conceptualizing and measuring engagement. Next, issues relevant to promoting effective engagement are discussed, including how best to tailor to individual needs and combine digital and human support. A key conclusion with regard to conceptualizing engagement is that it is important to understand the relationship between engagement with the digital intervention and the desired behavior change. This paper argues that it may be more valuable to establish and promote “effective engagement,” rather than simply more engagement, with “effective engagement” defined empirically as sufficient engagement with the intervention to achieve intended outcomes. Appraisal of the value and limitations of methods of assessing different aspects of engagement highlights the need to identify valid and efficient combinations of measures to develop and test multidimensional models of engagement. The final section of the paper reflects on how interventions can be designed to fit the user and their specific needs and context. Despite many unresolved questions posed by novel and rapidly changing technologies, there is widespread consensus that successful intervention design demands a user-centered and iterative approach to development, using mixed methods and in-depth qualitative research to progressively refine the intervention to meet user requirements.},

	abstract = {We assessed the impact of tailored versus targeted messages on program non-compliance during Desire2Move (D2M), an 8-week eHealth program that promotes physical activity (PA). Participants recorded minutes of PA using MapMyFitness, which counted toward their departments’ PA total. Departments were randomized into the targeted messaging (TM) or tailored messaging (TM+) group based on participant-reported goals. Participants who did not provide a goal were assigned to the control group (CG). Eligible participants were employees from invited departments who were non-compliant for at least 1 week of D2M. Upon initial non-compliance, participants across groups received a targeted email message prompting program resumption. For subsequent non-compliance, the TM group continued to receive the same targeted message. The TM+ group received a message tailored to the participant’s program goal. The CG group did not receive additional messages. Participants (n = 149) were mostly female (68.5\%), staff (44.3\%), with an average age of 43.7 (SD = 11.1). Analyses revealed significant group differences in non-compliance between TM+ (M = 2.6, SD = 1.9) and TM (M = 4.0, SD = 2.1), F(16,88) = 3.4, p \&lt; .01; d = .64, and between TM+ (M = 2.6, SD = 1.9) and CG (M = 3.8, SD = 2.1), F(1,74) = 13.3, p \&lt; .01; d = .56. There was no significant group difference between TM and CG, F(1,80) = 0.1, p = .75; d = .02. Tailored messages improved individual program compliance. More research is needed to assess the relationship between program compliance and PA behavior change.We compared the influence of tailored messages and targeted messages on participant non-compliance (defined as not logging any activity during a program week) during an 8-week eHealth program that encourages university employees to engage in physical activity (PA). Participants received targeted or tailored email message to encourage participants to begin logging PA again. Tailored messages improved individual program non-compliance.},

Respondents in the experimental group received additional psychosocial feedback tailored to their attitudes, perceived social support and self-efficacy expectations towards reducing their fat consumption and increasing their consumption of fruit and vegetables. A significant reduction in fat consumption and increase in the consumption of fruit and vegetables were found in both the experimental and the comparison group between pre-test and post-test. Respondents in the experimental group more often indicated that the feedback they received was interesting and easy to understand. Respondents in the comparison group more often reported having reduced their fat consumption because of the feedback they received. No significant differences in consumption of fat, fruit and vegetables were found at post-test between the experimental group and the comparison group. These results do not support the hypothesis that additional psychosocial information is an essential component of effective tailored feedback.

At 6-month follow-up, no differences in physical activity between study conditions were found; total physical activity, physical activity at moderate intensity and physical activity in leisure time significantly increased in all study conditions between baseline and follow-up. Further evaluation of the intervention materials showed that the tailored advice was more read, printed and discussed with others than the standard advice. Most of the respondents in the e-mail group indicated to be satisfied about the number, frequency and usefulness of the stage-based e-mails.

This study investigates the impact of the important smart tourism technology (STT) characteristics on travel decision support satisfaction and the moderating effects of self-efficacy on the main relationships. We adopted the elaboration likelihood model as an overarching theory to develop our hypotheses that revolve around both the central route and peripheral routes in the elaborated process, and tested the model with survey data collected from South Korea. The findings illustrate that STT characteristics of information quality, source credibility, interactivity, and accessibility have a positive influence on travel decision support satisfaction. Self-efficacy toward STT use was found to have a positive moderating impact on a hypothesized central route but negative moderating influence on three peripheral routes. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study are discussed.},

	abstract = {While evidence suggests that interventions based on self-determination theory have efficacy in motivating adoption and maintenance of health-related behaviors, and in promoting adaptive psychological outcomes, the motivational techniques that comprise the content of these interventions have not been comprehensively identified or described. The aim of the present study was to develop a classification system of the techniques that comprise self-determination theory interventions, with satisfaction of psychological needs as an organizing principle. Candidate techniques were identified through a comprehensive review of self-determination theory interventions and nomination by experts. The study team developed a preliminary list of candidate techniques accompanied by labels, definitions, and function descriptions of each. Each technique was aligned with the most closely related psychological need satisfaction construct (autonomy, competence, or relatedness). Using an iterative expert consensus procedure, participating experts (N = 18) judged each technique on the preliminary list for redundancy, essentiality, uniqueness, and the proposed link between the technique and basic psychological need. The procedure produced a final classification of 21 motivation and behavior change techniques (MBCTs). Redundancies between final MBCTs against techniques from existing behavior change technique taxonomies were also checked. The classification system is the first formal attempt to systematize self-determination theory intervention techniques. The classification is expected to enhance consistency in descriptions of self-determination theory-based interventions in health contexts, and assist in facilitating synthesis of evidence on interventions based on the theory. The classification is also expected to guide future efforts to identify, describe, and classify the techniques that comprise self-determination theory-based interventions in multiple domains.

	abstract = {This paper addresses speeding, that is, “too fast” responses, in web surveys. Relying on the response process model, we argue that very short response times indicate low data quality, stemming from a lack of attention on the part of respondents. To identify speeding, prior research employed case-wise procedures. Using data from nine online surveys, we demonstrate that response behavior of individual respondents varies considerably during a survey. Thus, we use case- and page-wise procedures to capture speeding behavior that taps different, although related, phenomena. Moreover, page-specific speeding measures capture aspects of data quality that traditional quality measures do not cover. Employing both page-specific and case-wise speeding measures, we examine whether removing speeders makes a difference in substantive findings. The evidence indicates that removing “too fast” responses does not alter marginal distributions, irrespective of which speeder-correction technique is employed. Moreover, explanatory models yield, by and large, negligible coefficient differences (on average about one standard error). Only in exceptional cases differences exceed two standard errors. Our findings suggest that speeding primarily adds some random noise to the data and attenuate correlations, if it makes a difference at all. The paper concludes by discussing implications and limitations.},

	abstract = {Objectives As sexual health information is increasingly presented digitally, and adolescents are increasingly seeking sexual health information on the internet, it is important to explore the challenges presented by this developing source of information provision. This study examined the key barriers and challenges faced by young people when accessing and using sexual health information online.Methods A novel qualitative approach was used which combined paired interviews with real-time online activities. A purposive sample of 49 young people aged between 16 and 19 years and diverse in terms of gender, sexuality, religion and socio-demographic background were recruited from areas across Scotland. Data analysis comprised framework analysis of conversational data (including pair interactions), descriptive analysis of observational data, and data integration.Results This study highlighted practical and socio-cultural barriers to engagement with online sexual health content. Key practical barriers included difficulty filtering overabundant content; limited awareness of specific, relevant, trusted online sources; difficulties in finding locally relevant information about services; and difficulties in navigating large organisations’ websites. Key socio-cultural barriers included fear of being observed; wariness about engaging with visual and auditory content; concern about unintentionally accessing sexually explicit content; and reticence to access sexual health information on social networking platforms or through smartphone applications. These practical and socio-cultural barriers restricted access to information and influenced searching practices.Conclusion This study provides insights into some of the key barriers faced by young people in accessing and engaging with sexual health information and support online. Reducing such challenges is essential. We highlight the need for sexual health information providers and intervention developers to produce online information that is accurate and accessible; to increase awareness of and promote reliable, accessible sources; and to be sensitive to young people’s concerns about ‘being seen’ accessing sexual health information regarding audio-visual content and platform choice.},

Participants were asked which of these reasons motivated them when they were deciding whether to use condoms in 503 sexual relationships. Participants were classified into one of three roles based on their HIV status and the status of each sexual partner: HIV+ people with HIV− partners; HIV− people with HIV+ partners; and HIV− people with HIV− partners. Motivations were looked at in the context of each of these roles. Of the 46 reasons, only 15 were selected by at least 1/3 of the participants, and only seven were selected by at least half. Frequently reported reasons primarily concern protecting self and partner from STDs including HIV. Less frequently reported reasons involved social norms, effects of condoms on sex, and concern for the relationship. These findings have implications for clinical interventions.},

The preliminary study involved nonrandomized assignment to message style and only immediate assessment of perceptions, motivation, and behavior, while the primary study involved randomized assignment and 4-month longitudinal assessments.Nearly 400 ninth- through 12th-grade students at 2 suburban high schools in upstate New York.Adolescents' perceptions of the presentations' autonomy supportiveness of the presenters, as well as adolescents' autonomous motivation for not smoking and their self-reports of smoking. The primary study also assessed change in students' autonomous motivation and change in their self-reported smoking during 4 months.In both studies, the measures were reliable and valid. Students perceived significantly (P=.04 and P\&lt;.001, respectively) greater autonomy support in the "It's Your Choice" presentation, after controlling for whether the students were smokers. Perceived autonomy supportiveness of the presentation was positively correlated with autonomous reasons for not smoking in the preliminary study and with increases in autonomous motivation for not smoking in the primary study. Change in autonomous reasons for not smoking significantly (P\&lt;.001) predicted reduction in smoking during 4 months.When adolescents perceived messages about not smoking as autonomy supportive, they had more autonomous motivation for not smoking, and that, in turn, predicted a decrease in their self-reports of smoking.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1999;153:959-964--{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: According to Erik Erikson, the main task of adolescents is to solve the crisis of identity versus role confusion. Research has shown that a stable and strong sense of identity is associated with better mental health of adolescents. Good relationships with peers are also linked with better emotional and psychological well-being of adolescents. However, there is a lack of reviews of studies in the scientific literature examining the relationship between the adolescents' identity development and relationships with peers. The aims of this article were to analyze links between adolescent identity development and relationships with peers identified from a literature review, summarize the results, and discuss the theoretical factors that may predict these relationships. METHOD: A systematic literature review. RESULTS: Analysis of findings from the systematic literature review revealed that a good relationship with peers is positively related to adolescent identity development, but empirical research in this area is extremely limited. CONCLUSIONS: The links between adolescents' identity development and their relationship with peers are not completely clear. The possible intermediate factors that could determine the relationship between adolescent identity development and their relationships with peers are discussed. Further empirical researches is needed in this area.},

Participants were randomly assigned to view a program that either did or did not depict characters modeling sexual discussion. Exposure to the modeled behavior motivated viewers to engage in sexual discussions over the next 2 weeks. Greater identification with these characters facilitated this effect by enhancing viewers' self-efficacy and reducing counterarguing.

Subjects (N = 116) competed in a basketball free-throw shooting game, following which they completed the IMI. The LISREL VI computer program was employed to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the tenability of a five factor hierarchical model representing four first-order factors or dimensions and a second-order general factor representing intrinsic motivation. Indices of model acceptability tentatively suggest that the sport data adequately fit the hypothesized five factor hierarchical model. Alternative models were tested but did not result in significant improvements in the goodness-of-fit indices, suggesting the proposed model to be the most accurate of the models tested. Coefficient alphas for the four dimensions and the overall scale indicated adequate reliability. The results are discussed with regard to the importance of accurate assessment of psychological constructs and the use of linear structural equations in confirming the factor structures of measures.},

The narrative was more effective in increasing cervical cancer-related knowledge and attitudes. Moreover, in response to the narrative featuring Latinas, Mexican Americans were most transported, identified most with the characters, and experienced the strongest emotions. Regressions revealed that transportation, identification with specific characters, and emotion contributed to shifts in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions.

	abstract = {Objectives To examine how the prediction of condom-related cognitions, intentions, and behaviour amongst adolescents may differ according to gender and sexual experience within a theory of planned behaviour (TPB) framework.
Methods Adolescents (N ϭ 306) completed questionnaires about sexual experience, condom use, TPB variables, perceived risk, and safe sex knowledge.
Results Signiﬁcant differences in TPB variables, perceived risk, and knowledge were found; males and sexually experienced participants were generally less positive about condom use. Twenty percent of the variance in attitudes was accounted for by four variables; speciﬁcally, female gender, no previous sexual experience, better safe sex knowledge, and greater risk perceptions were associated with more positive attitudes. The prediction of intentions separately amongst sexually experienced (R2 ϭ 0.468) and inexperienced (R2 ϭ 0.436) participants revealed that, for the former group, attitudes and subjective norms were the most important considerations. In contrast, among the inexperienced participants, attitudes and the gender-by-perceived risk interaction term represented signiﬁcant inﬂuences.
Conclusions The results suggest that interventions designed to improve adolescents’ intentions to use condoms and rates of actual condom use should consider differences in gender and sexual experience.},

The dependent measure was the amount of time they waited for the preferred outcome before forfeiting it for the sake of the less desired but immediately available one. Results contradict predictions from psychodynamic theory and from speculations concerning self-instructions during time binding. Unexpectedly, but in accord with frustrative nonreward theory, voluntary waiting time was substantially increased when Ss could not attend to rewards during the waiting period. Implications are discussed for a theory of the development of delay of gratification. (22 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Concentrating on children whose mothers had not completed college, we found that an additional minute waited at age 4 predicted a gain of approximately one tenth of a standard deviation in achievement at age 15. But this bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Background: Smoking continues to be a driver of mortality. Various forms of evidence-based cessation assistance exist; however, their use is limited. The choice between them may also induce decisional conflict. Offering decision aids (DAs) may be beneficial; however, insights into their effective elements are lacking. Objective: This study tested the added value of an effective element (ie, an “explicit value clarification method” paired with computer-tailored advice indicating the most fitting cessation assistance) of a web-based smoking cessation DA. Methods: A web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted among smokers motivated to stop smoking within 6 months. The intervention group received a DA with the aforementioned elements, and the control group received the same DA without these elements. The primary outcome measure was 7-day point prevalence abstinence 6 months after baseline (time point 3 [t=3]). Secondary outcome measures were 7-day point prevalence of abstinence 1 month after baseline (time point 2 [t=2]), evidence-based cessation assistance use (t=2 and t=3), and decisional conflict (immediately after DA; time point 1). Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to assess the outcomes. Analyses were conducted following 2 (decisional conflict) and 3 (smoking cessation) outcome scenarios: complete cases, worst-case scenario (assuming that dropouts still smoked), and multiple imputations. A priori sample size calculation indicated that 796 participants were needed. The participants were mainly recruited on the web (eg, social media). All the data were self-reported. Results: Overall, 2375 participants were randomized (intervention n=1164, 49.01\%), of whom 599 (25.22\%; intervention n=275, 45.91\%) completed the DAs, and 276 (11.62\%; intervention n=143, 51.81\%), 97 (4.08\%; intervention n=54, 55.67\%), and 103 (4.34\%; intervention n=56, 54.37\%) completed time point 1, t=2, and t=3, respectively. More participants stopped smoking in the intervention group (23/63, 37\%) than in the control group (14/52, 27\%) after 6 months; however, this was only statistically significant in the worst-case scenario (crude P=.02; adjusted P=.04). Effects on the secondary outcomes were only observed for smoking abstinence after 1 month (15/55, 27\%, compared with 7/46, 15\%, in the crude and adjusted models, respectively; P=.02) and for cessation assistance uptake after 1 month (26/56, 46\% compared with 18/47, 38\% only in the crude model; P=.04) and 6 months (38/61, 62\% compared with 26/50, 52\%; crude P=.01; adjusted P=.02) but only in the worst-case scenario. Nonuse attrition was 34.19\% higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Currently, we cannot confidently recommend the inclusion of explicit value clarification methods and computer-tailored advice. However, they might result in higher nonuse attrition rates, thereby limiting their potential. As a lack of statistical power may have influenced the outcomes, we recommend replicating this study with some adaptations based on the lessons learned.

Objective: This study aimed to identify the most autonomy-supportive message frame within an intervention for increasing vegetable intake by testing the effect of the following 2 strategies: (1) using autonomy-supportive language and (2) providing choice. Methods: A Web-based 2 (autonomy-supportive vs controlling language)×2 (choice vs no choice) experiment was conducted among 526 participants, recruited via a research panel. The main outcome measures were perceived autonomy support (measured using the Virtual Care Climate Questionnaire, answered with scores 1 to 5), perceived relevance (measured with one question, answered with scores 1 to 5), and overall evaluation of the intervention (measured with 1 open-ended question, answered with scores 1 to 10). Results: Choice had a significant positive effect on the overall evaluation of the intervention (b=.12; P=.003), whereas for participants with a high need for autonomy, there was a significant positive effect on perceived relevance (b=.13; P=.02). The positive effect of choice on perceived autonomy support approached significance (b=.07; P=.07). No significant effects on any of the three outcomes were observed for language. Conclusions: Results suggest that provision of choice rather than the use of autonomy-supportive language can be an easy-to-implement strategy to increase the effectiveness of digital forms of health communication, especially for people with a high need for autonomy.},

Study 1 established the existence of a relationship between goal framing and global self-evaluations, or psychological well being, subjects with more avoidance goals evaluated themselves more negatively on measures of self-steem, optimism, and depression. Study 2 confirmed the causal role of goal framing in this relationship, for self perceptions of success and satisfaction differed as a function of manipulated approach versus avoidance goals.},

The challenge framework posits that performance goals facilitate achievement only on simple tasks, and that mastery goals do so on challenging tasks. The depth of learning framework posits that performance goals facilitate achievement only when assignments assess superficial topic knowledge, and that mastery goals do so when assignments assess deeper knowledge. The learning agenda framework posits that performance goals facilitate achievement only if task demands are clear, and that mastery goals can do so if students’ interests match the core topics assessed on assignments. In a test of these frameworks, university students from numerous courses reported their achievement goals and study strategies for an upcoming exam. Exams served as the measure of academic achievement and were also coded for features relevant to each framework’s hypothesized moderator variable. Analyses supported only the learning agenda framework. Discussion suggests additional ways to test each framework and considers implications for teachers and goal theorists.},

The aim of the study is (1) to examine workers’ expectations of outcomes of mental illness disclosure in the workplace and to evaluate their expectations regarding which factors are of influence on these outcomes, (2) to identify distinct subgroups of workers, and (3) to characterize these subgroups in terms of personal, sociodemographic, and work-related characteristics. Methods In this cross-sectional survey study, a sample of 1224 Dutch workers was used. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify classes of workers based on expected workplace mental illness outcomes. A three-step approach LCA was chosen to investigate whether the classes differed in characteristics. Results The majority of workers expected predominantly positive outcomes of workplace mental illness disclosure (e.g., being able to be one’s authentic self; 82.4\%), even though they simultaneously expected disclosure to lead to advancement-related discrimination (e.g., lower chances of contract renewal; or getting a promotion; 68.4\% and 57\%, respectively). Six distinct subgroups of workers were identified based on expected workplace mental illness disclosure outcomes: two positive classes (50.1\%), two negative classes (33.3\%), and two classes who indicated not to know what the outcomes would be (16.7\%). Significant differences between the classes were found on personal experience, work-related association with mental illness, gender, educational level, and workplace atmosphere. Conclusion The disclosure process is complex, as most workers were optimistic (i.e., expected generally positive outcomes) whilst simultaneously expecting workplace discrimination. Subgroup differences in expectations regarding workplace mental illness disclosure outcomes were found.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen’s kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from −1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen’s suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

	doi = {10.17605/OSF.IO/9ZVF6},
	abstract = {A content analysis of Instagram posts concerning HIV and AIDS will be performed to investigate how Instagram users communicate about HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, and treatment. Instagram is popular around the globe (1.478 mln. monthly active users; (Statista, 2022)) and is extensively used to communicate about HIV and AIDS, for example to share experiences, but also to motivate HIV testing and other preventative behaviors (Nobles et al., 2020). For these posts to be effective in motivating people to take a decision around HIV and AIDS prevention but also regarding testing and treatment, we believe they should adhere to certain standards. That is why we aim to explore how communication takes place in the context of three themes: Informed Decision Making (IDM), misconceptions about HIV and AIDS, and key psychological needs for motivation according to self-determination theory. Additionally, we will analyze whether communication in line with these themes has an influence on engagement with posts in terms of number of comments. Hereafter, we will shortly address all the themes. 
In the past, several decision aids have been created to help people make informed choices in the context of their own health. Minimum standards for the qualification of such decision aids have been developed (Durand et al., 2015). It is our goal to assess to what extent posts about HIV and AIDS adhere to these minimum standards, thereby aiming to draw conclusions on the potential impact of such Instagram posts on autonomous and informed decision making. It is our expectation that posts qualifying as decision aid will differ in engagement in terms of number of comments as compared to posts not qualifying as decision aid. Second, our analysis will shed light on the degree to which misconceptions about HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, and treatment are prevalent on Instagram. Misconceptions are associated with more stigma towards people living with HIV and AIDS (Qian et al., 2007) and being stigmatized can in turn interfere with initiation and/or maintenance of HIV and AIDS prevention, HIV testing and HIV treatment (Ekstrand et al., 2012). We aim to gain insight into which misconceptions would deserve the most attention in public campaigns or interventions to debunk such misconceptions. It is our expectation that posts endorsing misconceptions will differ in engagement in terms of number of comments as compared to posts not dealing with misconceptions. Additionally, we expect that posts refuting misconceptions will differ in engagement in terms of number of comments as compared to posts not dealing with misconceptions. Third, following self-determination theory, we intend to investigate to what degree the three key psychological needs are being supported or thwarted in Instagram postings, thereby assessing to what extent Instagram posts are currently helpful in autonomously motivating people to initiate and maintain HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, and treatment behaviors. It is our expectation that posts supporting either one or more key psychological needs will differ in engagement in terms of number of comments as compared to posts not supporting these needs. 
We will compare results for the above mentioned three concepts across continents as they seem to be relevant across regions around the globe, however communication may differ between regions. Misconceptions seem to be common and show similarities across continents: for example, Be In The Know (formerly known as Avert), a website focusing on East and Southern Africa (https://www.beintheknow.org/hiv-and-stis/hiv-prevention/how-do-you-get-hiv) and the Dutch organization Soa Aids Nederland (https://www.soaaids.nl/nl/alle-soas/hiv/wat-is-aids-wat-is-hiv), largely focus on debunking the same misconceptions in their communication. Also, the three key needs in SDT – autonomy, competence, and relatedness – have been found to be present across cultures (Chen et al., 2014). Since the community on Instagram is a global one, we are interested to see whether there are indications for cultural differences in communication about HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, and treatment, specifically with respect to IDM, misconceptions, and SDT. We realize that there can be vast differences within continents and that this is only a first step in discovering potential patterns. Finally, other factors such as characteristics of the posters will also be explored.},

Together, these systems of oppression create unique body image disturbances for Black women. We highlight literature that focuses on the specific ways in which Black women may encounter body image concerns—ways that differ from the experiences of White women to whom Black women have historically been compared. We conclude this review by highlighting factors that may foster body satisfaction among Black women, with a focus on strengths and protective factors.},

	abstract = {Mobile health interventions are promising behavior change tools. However, there is a concern that they may benefit some populations less than others and thus widen inequalities in health. This systematic review investigated differences in uptake of, engagement with, and effectiveness of mobile interventions for weight-related behaviors (i.e., diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) based on a range of inequality indicators including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020192473). Six databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Web of Science) were searched from inception to July 2021. Publications were eligible for inclusion if they reported the results of an exclusively mobile intervention and examined outcomes by at least one inequality indicator. Sixteen publications reporting on 13 studies were included with most reporting on multiple behaviors and inequality indicators. Uptake was investigated in one study with no differences reported by the inequality indicators studied. Studies investigating engagement (n = 7) reported differences by age (n = 1), gender (n = 3), ethnicity (n = 2), and education (n = 2), while those investigating effectiveness (n = 9) reported differences by age (n = 3), gender (n = 5), education (n = 2), occupation (n = 1), and geographical location (n = 1). Given the limited number of studies and their inconsistent findings, evidence of the presence of a digital divide in mobile interventions targeting weight-related behaviors is inconclusive. Therefore, we recommend that inequality indicators are specifically addressed, analyzed, and reported when evaluating mobile interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Black African women living in the United Kingdom suffer from inequalities in health, care and maternity outcomes compared with their counterparts. Their presence has however been found to be lacking in life-saving healthcare research. As a result of a lack of engagement in healthcare research, some authors have classified them as “hard to reach”. However, in order to reduce the health inequalities experienced by this group, methods for engagement that would suit this population group would need to be explored. Therefore, this study set out to present an ethnic specific perspective of the barriers and facilitators to the recruitment of black African women to research from the researcher’s perspective. Method: Two studies were conducted aimed at the recruitment of Black African women in healthcare research. Proposed recruitment strategies included snowballing, social media (twitter, Facebook), flyers and collaboration with gatekeepers in two NHS trusts in London. The strategies were developed based on a review of literature, best practice ethics guidelines and consultations with experts in the field. Results: Successful recruitment strategies included snowball sampling, word of mouth, peer to peer recruitment and the use of influential members in the community. Existing recruitment strategies were found to be unsuitable to properly engage members of this community. In addition to this, ethical guidelines around informed consent and gatekeeping seem to impede the successful engagement of the members of this community. Conclusion: Proper methods of engagement are required to bridge the inequality gap. Therefore, it is important that ethical procedures, processes, and recruitment methods be reviewed such that it will take into consideration the cultural peculiarities of individuals within this community.},

One key to reforming science is a simple and scalable practice: pre-registration. Pre-registration constitutes pre-specifying an analysis plan prior to data collection. A growing chorus of articles discusses the prescriptive, field-wide benefits of pre-registration. To increase adoption, however, scientists need to know who currently pre-registers and understand perceived barriers to doing so. Thus, we weigh costs and benefits of pre-registration. Our survey of researchers reveals generational differences in who pre-registers and uncertainty regarding how pre-registration benefits individual researchers. We leverage these data to directly address researchers’ uncertainty by clarifying why pre-registration improves the research process itself. Finally, we discuss how to pre-register and compare available resources. The present work examines the who, why, and how of pre-registration in order to weigh the costs and benefits of pre-registration to researchers and motivate continued adoption.},

To this end, we surveyed 355 researchers, 299 of whom had used preregistration in their own work. The researchers indicated the experienced or expected effects of preregistration on their workflow. The results show that experiences and expectations are mostly positive. Researchers in our sample believe that implementing preregistration improves or is likely to improve the quality of their projects. Criticism of preregistration is primarily related to the increase in work-related stress and the overall duration of the project. While the benefits outweighed the challenges for the majority of researchers with preregistration experience, this was not the case for the majority of researchers without preregistration experience. The experienced advantages and disadvantages identified in our survey could inform future efforts to improve preregistration and thus help the methodology gain greater acceptance in the scientific community.},

However, the current guidelines for preregistration have been developed primarily for studies where new data will be collected. Yet, preregistering secondary data analyses--- where new analyses are proposed for existing data---is just as important, given that researchers’ hypotheses and analyses may be biased by their prior knowledge of the data. The need for proper guidance in this area is especially desirable now that data is increasingly shared publicly. In this tutorial, we present a template specifically designed for the preregistration of secondary data analyses and provide comments and a worked example that may help with using the template effectively. Through this illustration, we show that completing such a template is feasible, helps limit researcher degrees of freedom, and may make researchers more deliberate in their data selection and analysis efforts.},

Heteronormativity is an ideology that implicitly holds that heterosexuality is, and should be, the only, dominant, or taken-for-granted sexuality for all. The movement towards sexual equality, particularly legal recognition of equal marriage, now allows psychologists to investigate romantic love in a more equal manner than ever before. To orient psychology towards less heteronormative theories of love, we make explicit how researchers in the past have (a) defined love and relationships as heterosexual, (b) presumed heterosexual patterns of love generalize to all, (c) used methodologies that introduce heterosexual bias, and (d) located differences in same-gender couples rather than between same-gender and opposite-gender couples. We conclude with recommendations on how critical thinking at all stages of research can make the difference between heteronormative and inclusive research on romantic love and relationships.},

	abstract = {BackgroundIndividuals often avoid or delay seeking professional help for mental health problems. Stigma may be a key deterrent to help-seeking but this has not been reviewed systematically. Our systematic review addressed the overarching question: What is the impact of mental health-related stigma on help-seeking for mental health problems? Subquestions were: (a) What is the size and direction of any association between stigma and help-seeking? (b) To what extent is stigma identified as a barrier to help-seeking? (c) What processes underlie the relationship between stigma and help-seeking? (d) Are there population groups for which stigma disproportionately deters help-seeking?MethodFive electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2011 and references of reviews checked. A meta-synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies, comprising three parallel narrative syntheses and subgroup analyses, was conducted.ResultsThe review identified 144 studies with 90 189 participants meeting inclusion criteria. The median association between stigma and help-seeking was d = − 0.27, with internalized and treatment stigma being most often associated with reduced help-seeking. Stigma was the fourth highest ranked barrier to help-seeking, with disclosure concerns the most commonly reported stigma barrier. A detailed conceptual model was derived that describes the processes contributing to, and counteracting, the deterrent effect of stigma on help-seeking. Ethnic minorities, youth, men and those in military and health professions were disproportionately deterred by stigma.ConclusionsStigma has a small- to moderate-sized negative effect on help-seeking. Review findings can be used to help inform the design of interventions to increase help-seeking.},

	abstract = {Socioeconomic differences in health-related behaviors are a major cause of health inequalities. However, the mechanisms (mediation/moderation) by which socioeconomic status (SES) affects health behavior are a topic of ongoing debate.Current research on SES as moderator of the health cognitions–health behavior relation is inconsistent. Previous studies are limited by diverse operationalizations of SES and health behaviors, demographically narrow samples, and between-person designs addressing within-person processes. This paper presents two studies addressing these shortcomings in a within-person multibehavior framework using hierarchical linear models.Two online studies, one cross-sectional and one 4 week longitudinal, assessed 1,005 (Study 1; Amazon MTurk; USA only) and 1,273 participants (Study 2; Prolific; international). Self-reports of multiple SES indicators (education, income, occupation status; ZIP code in Study 1), health cognitions (from the theory of planned behavior), and measures of six health behaviors were taken. Multilevel models with cross-level interactions tested whether the within-person relationships between health cognitions and behaviors differed by between-person SES.Education significantly moderated intention-behavior and attitude-behavior relationships in both studies, with more educated individuals showing stronger positive relationships. In addition, ZIP-level SES (Study 1) moderated attitude-behavior effects such that these relationships were stronger in participants living in areas with higher SES.Education appears to be an important resource for the translation of intentions and attitudes into behavior. Other SES indicators showed less consistent effects. This has implications for interventions aiming at increasing intentions to change health behaviors, as some interventions might inadvertently increase health inequalities.},

	abstract = {Background
Health inequalities are to a substantial degree due to socioeconomic status (SES) related differences in health behaviors such as physical activity. However, little is known about the role SES plays in the self-regulation of physical activity.
Purpose
This systematic review with meta-analysis examines whether a comprehensive set of indicators of SES (income, education, occupational status) impacts on the behavioral self-regulation by moderating the relationships between social cognitions in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and physical activity.
Methods
A systematic literature search identified 99 studies from 88 articles that provided information on sample SES and correlations between TPB variables and physical activity. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool correlations corrected for sampling and measurement error. Random-effects meta-regression was used to examine moderating effects of study-level SES on these correlations.
Results
Education moderated the relationship between intentions and physical activity, such that studies with better educated samples reported stronger intention-physical activity relationships.
Conclusions
These results suggest that education might play a major role in the self-regulation of physical activity, with better educated samples more likely to translate intentions into behavior. This can both help to explain heterogeneity in the relation between intentions and physical activity as well as support the development of more effective interventions targeting intentions and physical activity.},

	abstract = {Objective
Adherence to protection behaviours remains key to curbing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, but there are substantial differences in individual adherence to recommendations according to socio-structural factors. To better understand such differences, the current research examines whether relationships between health cognitions based on the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) and eight COVID-19 protection behaviours vary as a function of participant-level socio-structural factors.
Methods
Within-person design with behaviours nested within participants in a two-wave online survey (one week delay) conducted during the UK national lockdown in April 2020. A UK representative sample of 477 adults completed baseline measures from the RAA plus perceived susceptibility and past behaviour for eight protection behaviours, and self-reported behaviour one week later. Moderated hierarchical linear models with cross-level interactions were used to test moderation of health cognitions by socio-structural factors (sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation).
Results
Sex, ethnicity and deprivation moderated the effects of health cognitions on protection intentions and behaviour. For example, the effects of injunctive norms on intentions were stronger in men compared to women. Importantly, intention was a weaker predictor of behaviour in more compared to less deprived groups. In addition, there was evidence that perceived autonomy was a stronger predictor of behaviour in more deprived groups.
Conclusion
Socio-structural variables affect how health cognitions relate to recommended COVID-19 protection behaviours. As a result, behavioural interventions based on social-cognitive theories might be less effective in participants from disadvantaged backgrounds.},

However, the present preregistration landscape leaves some room for improvement. First, preregistration forms are administered by a select few organizations, which constrains methodological and epistemic diversity. This can be brought more in line with the democratic principles underlying Open Science by making it easy for anybody to create preregistration forms. Second, preregistration forms are not machine-readable, requiring resource-intensive and error-prone work to be compiled into a dataset analysable for meta-scientific purposes. We present \{preregr\}, an R package allowing anybody to create a preregistration form. We explain how to use it, briefly illustrate this at the hand of the Inclusivity \& Diversity Add-on for preregistration forms, and describe a number of methods that can be used to arrive at new preregistration forms with their benefits and drawbacks.},
