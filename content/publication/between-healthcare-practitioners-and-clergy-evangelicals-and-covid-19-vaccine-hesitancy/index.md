abstract: Evangelical Christians are among the most hesitant to get the COVID-19
  vaccine. This study examined the extent to which COVID-19 vaccination uptake
  among Evangelicals is explained by demographic characteristics, Health Belief
  Model constructs, and faith-based support factors. Survey research firm
  Qualtrics recruited 531 U.S. adults and conducted a survey to explore
  predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people who self-identified as
  Evangelicals in September 2021. A logistic regression showed that those
  reporting high perceived benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to
  be vaccinated, while those reporting high perceived barriers were less likely
  to be vaccinated. Those whose healthcare provider asked them about the vaccine
  were more likely to be vaccinated than those whose healthcare provider did not
  ask. Finally, while those who reported information seeking from religious
  leaders were less likely to be vaccinated, those who reported more faith-based
  support for vaccination were more likely to be vaccinated. In addition to
  beliefs about benefits and barriers to vaccination, the role of healthcare
  providers and clergy were important factors influencing vaccination status.
  Intervention efforts that capitalize on partnerships between health providers
  and clergy in supportive congregations may be able to reach undecided
  Evangelicals.
