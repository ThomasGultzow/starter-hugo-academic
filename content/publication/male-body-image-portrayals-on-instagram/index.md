abstract: Men are faced with trends that give rise to the desire for a muscular
  and lean body; this may result in body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction
  is associated with a plethora of health consequences. Social media has been
  named as one contributing factor for male body dissatisfaction. Up till now,
  women have been the focus of body image-related social media studies.
  Therefore, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of 1,000 relevant
  Instagram posts that were posted by men (and/or depicted men) to understand
  how the male body is depicted on Instagram and how user respond to those
  images. The majority of sampled posts showed high levels of muscularity and
  leanness. In addition, posts depicting men adhering to this specific body type
  received significantly more responses (likes and comments). Norms and outcomes
  related to health (i.e., training to be healthy) were more commonly shown than
  appearance-related constructs (i.e., training to become attractive), and
  promotion of physical activity was more common than dietary behavior. However,
  findings are potential harmful to men's body image, even if one considers that
  health-related messaging and physical active promotion was prominent. It
  remains debatable if men need to view very lean and very muscular men to
  encourage health-related behaviors.
