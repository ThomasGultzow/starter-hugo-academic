abstract: "People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, and
  people who hold other marginalised sexual or gender identities (LGBTQI+) often
  experience notable health disparities. These disparities arise due to a
  complex interplay between social, cultural, structural, and political factors.
  Yet, within the European Health Psychology Society (EHPS), queer-related
  topics, especially those beyond the scope of gay men and men who have sex with
  men, have received relatively little attention. Therefore a roundtable focused
  on this topic was organised during the 2023 EHPS conference to (1) briefly
  present various projects as examples of how health psychology has and can make
  a positive contribution to LGBTQI+ health, (2) map out why LGBTQI+ issues
  receive relatively less attention within health psychology and what other
  areas can learn from decades of work focusing on LGBTQI+ health, and (3)
  generate new broad research goals to give new impetus to LGBTQI+ focused
  research within health psychology. The discussion focused on four broad
  themes: (1) assessment and measurement of LGBTQI+-related characteristics and
  data analysis, (2) labelling and the potential for 'othering', (3) balancing
  idealism, activism, and scientific discourse, and (4) balancing individual and
  environmental foci and the role of interdisciplinary teams. While the
  roundtable sparked an in-depth discussions of LGBTQI+ topics within health
  psychology, there remains a critical need for a more comprehensive exploration
  of this topic."
