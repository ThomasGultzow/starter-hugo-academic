abstract: In the transitioning era towards the COVID-19 endemic, there is still
  a sizable population that has never been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the
  Netherlands. This study employs Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling to assess
  the relative chances of COVID-19 vaccination uptake – first, second, and
  booster doses – both at the municipal and regional (public health services)
  levels. Incorporating ecological regression modelling to consider
  socio-demographic factors, our study unveils a diverse spatio-temporal
  distribution of vaccination uptake. Notably, the areas located in or around
  the Dutch main urban area (Randstad) and regions that are more religiously
  conservative exhibit a below-average likelihood of vaccination. Analysis at
  the municipal level within public health service regions indicates internal
  heterogeneity. Additionally, areas with a higher proportion of non-Western
  migrants consistently show lower chances of vaccination across vaccination
  dose scenarios. These findings highlight the need for tailored national and
  local vaccination strategies. Particularly, more regional efforts are
  essential to address vaccination disparities, especially in regions with
  elevated proportions of marginalized populations. This insight informs ongoing
  COVID-19 campaigns, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions for
  optimizing health outcomes during the second booster phase, especially in
  regions with a relatively higher proportion of marginalized populations.
