abstract: "People make numerous health-related choices each day: For example,
  deciding to brush one’s teeth or to eat well and healthy – or not to do these
  activities. To support complex decisions and subsequent behaviour change, both
  Behaviour Change Interventions (BCIs) and Patient Decision Aids (PtDAs) have
  been developed and evolved independently to support people in health-related
  decision making. In this paper, we critically review BCIs and PtDAs, examine
  their similarities and differences, and identify potential for integration of
  expertise to increase the benefits for people engaging with healthcare and
  health behaviours. The two approaches appear to mainly differ in terms of
  their (1) goals and foci, (2) theoretical basis, (3) development frameworks,
  (4) active ingredients and (5) effect evaluation. To facilitate the
  integration of scientific insights from these two fields, we recommend to (1)
  bring both fields together and promote interprofessional discussions, (2)
  train (health) professionals to recognise strengths of both approaches, (3)
  investigate the synergy of the two fields, (4) be prepared for and try to
  mitigate a culture shock when the fields start to interact. Knowledge
  generated by researching PtDAs could be used to facilitate decisional
  processes that enable patients to choose goals that are in line with their
  values and preferences, while insights from researching BCIs could be used to
  facilitate engagement with, and implementation of those goals. This
  integration could allow researchers and intervention providers to increase the
  benefits for people engaging with healthcare and health behaviours."
