abstract: Couples who are at risk of transmitting a genetic disease to their
  offspring may face difficult challenges regarding reproductive
  decision-making. Deciding if, and how, to purse their child wish can be a
  demanding process. This study aims to describe the reproductive joint
  decision-making process of genetically at-risk couples. A qualitative study
  was conducted with 16 couples (N=31) at risk of transmitting a genetic disease
  to their offspring and who received genetic counseling. Most couples were not
  aware of all available reproductive options in the Netherlands. A variety of
  motives was reported with almost all couples expressing a preference towards a
  reproductive option in which the child is genetically related to both parents.
  Only a few couples considered other options such as the use of donor gametes,
  adoption, and foster parenting. All couples indicated that they had multiple
  conversations to reach a mutually supported reproductive decision. Several
  carriers reported feelings of guilt and in some couples, the woman appeared to
  have a greater impact in the decision-making process as she should carry a
  pregnancy and should undergo medical treatments. This study provides insight
  in the extensive decision-making process of genetically at-risk couples and
  the role of both partners in this process. These findings can guide the
  development of genetic counseling (e.g., increase awareness of available
  reproductive options) and decision support for these couples.
