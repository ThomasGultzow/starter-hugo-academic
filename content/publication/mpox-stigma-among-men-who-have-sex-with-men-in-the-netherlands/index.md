abstract: People with mpox are likely to be stigmatized because of analogies to
  other sexually transmitted infections. Stigma is driven by beliefs about the
  perceived severity of the condition and perceived responsibility for acquiring
  the condition, both in broader society and individual responsibility. We
  explored these beliefs and compared them across mpox, HIV, syphilis,
  gonorrhoea, and chlamydia in an online survey, conducted in July, 2022, with
  394 men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in the Netherlands. We compared mean
  scores between infections using repeated measures ANOVA and conducted
  hierarchical regression analyses to identify determinants of both mpox
  perceived responsibility endpoints. Results showed that participants expected
  that mpox would be seen as a ‘gay disease’ and will be used to blame gay men.
  Compared to other infections, mpox was considered less severe than HIV, but
  more severe than syphilis, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia. Perceived responsibility
  was comparable across infections, but, for each infection, participants
  perceived attributed responsibility for infection to be higher in society than
  individual responsibility. Both perceived responsibility endpoints were highly
  correlated with each other and with other stigma beliefs. These results
  provide insight on the underlying determinants of mpox stigma, and demonstrate
  that mpox stigma is present in the Netherlands.
