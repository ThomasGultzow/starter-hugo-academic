abstract: As research highlights the impact that climate change has on
  individual and planetary health, people might consider whether and how to
  reduce their ecological footprint, e.g., by engaging in pro-environmental
  behaviours (PEBs). However, the decision to engage in these behaviours might
  depend on how far along they are in the process of deciding to act
  pro-environmentally (i.e., different stages of decision making) and on their
  experienced difficulty in deciding in favour of the environment and which
  behaviour to conduct, (i.e., decisional conflict). To explore in which stage
  participants find themselves when it comes to environmental decisions and if
  their respective stages are associated with their experienced decisional
  conflict, an online questionnaire was distributed among a convenience sample
  of 418 English-, Dutch-, and Italian-speaking adults to measure determinants
  of PEBs, participants’ stages, and the extent to which they experience
  decisional conflict. We observed that participants who were further along in
  the stages experienced less decisional conflict. Therefore, we suggest that
  future interventions (e.g., decision aids) should take into account stages of
  decision making to better meet users’ needs, this can assist people in making
  environmentally friendly decisions.
