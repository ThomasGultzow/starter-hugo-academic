abstract: Decisions around mental health disclosure are often complex,
  especially within university settings. To support students and staff at
  Maastricht University, a decision aid was developed to guide this process.
  This article presents findings from a think-aloud usability test and pilot
  study with Maastricht University students and staff to refine the tool before
  wider use. During the think-aloud study, participants tested the decision aid
  while verbalizing their thoughts. After the think-aloud sessions, we piloted
  the decision aid at the university, asking early users to complete a brief
  questionnaire. The think-aloud study showed positive user experiences, no
  major issues, and insights for refining the decision aid and guiding other
  decision aid developers. The pilot study participants reported no issues,
  using the decision aid to evaluate options post-decision and to consider
  disclosure. Future efforts should therefore focus on careful, systematic
  implementation and larger-scale testing (e.g., in the form of a randomized
  controlled trial) to ensure the tool effectively addresses the diverse needs
  of users.
