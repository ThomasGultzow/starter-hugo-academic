abstract: The development, evaluation, and implementation of digital health
  interventions requires contributions from scientists, healthcare
  professionals, and developers. Albeit exciting, interdisciplinary and
  cross-sectoral collaboration is challenging and so often slow and its impact
  limited. By outlining challenges and potential action-oriented solutions we
  aim to stimulate meaningful interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral
  collaborations.
