abstract: (Pre)registrations may be useful to make psychological research both
  more diverse and more inclusive. However, to our knowledge there was no
  (pre)registration form available until now that focused on diversity and
  inclusivity, so we took the opportunity to develop one during a set of
  pre-conference workshops at the European Health Psychology Society (EHPS)
  conference held in 2022 in Bratislava (Slovakia). This article describes the
  development and introduces the 'Inclusivity & Diversity Add-On for
  Preregistration Forms.'
