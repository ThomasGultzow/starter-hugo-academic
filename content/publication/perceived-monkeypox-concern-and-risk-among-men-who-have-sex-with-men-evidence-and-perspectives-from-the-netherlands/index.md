abstract: The current monkeypox epidemic is most prevalent among men who have
  sex with men (MSM). PrEP users and MSM with HIV (MSMHIV) are considered at
  highest risk of monkeypox infection in The Netherlands, and are being targeted
  for monkeypox vaccination. Together with the epidemiological evidence,
  perceived concern and risk are also relevant for decision making about health
  behaviour, e.g., vaccination uptake. It is thus timely to examine which
  subpopulations among MSM consider themselves to be most at risk and are most
  concerned about monkeypox. This study aimed to help determine if the current
  measures to curb the epidemic are successfully targeted or not in The
  Netherlands. We conducted an online survey among 394 MSM living in The
  Netherlands. We first calculated the prevalence and standardised prevalence
  ratio (SPR) of high perceived monkeypox concern/risk by PrEP-use and HIV
  status. We then conducted two multivariable logistic regression analyses to
  investigate perceived monkeypox concern/risk and their potential
  socio-demographic/behavioural/health/psycho-social determinants. Among the
  included MSM, 52% showed high perceived concern about and 30% showed high
  perceived risk of monkeypox infection. PrEP users (SPR = 0.83) showed a
  significantly lower chance of perceived concern; in addition, MSMHIV (SPR =
  2.09) were found to have a significantly higher chance of perceiving high risk
  of monkeypox infection. In the multivariable logistic analyses, non-PrEP users
  (aOR = 2.55) were more likely to perceive higher concern, while MSM who were
  retired (aOR = 0.23) and who had had chemsex recently (aOR = 0.63) were less
  likely to perceive higher concern. MSMHIV (aOR = 4.29) and MSM who had an
  unknown/undisclosed HIV status (aOR = 6.07), who had attended private sex
  parties (aOR = 2.10), and who knew people who have/had monkeypox (aOR = 2.10)
  were more likely to perceive a higher risk for monkeypox infection. We found
  that high perceived risk (aOR = 2.97) and high perceived concern (aOR = 3.13)
  were correlated with each other. In sum, only one-third of MSM living in The
  Netherlands considered themselves at high risk of monkeypox infection, and
  only half of them reported high concern. We identified a potential discrepancy
  between “actual risk” and perceived risk of and concern about monkeypox among
  MSM in this early stage of the monkeypox epidemic in The Netherlands,
  especially among PrEP users and MSMHIV. More refined public health
  communication strategies may be needed to improve the understanding and
  knowledge of the “actual risk” of monkeypox infections among MSM
  sub-populations, to facilitate health behaviour uptake.
