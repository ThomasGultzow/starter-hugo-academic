abstract: An intuitive style in eating decision-making, for example, basing
  decisions on one's gut feeling, has been related to a less healthy diet,
  whereas deliberately deciding what to eat, such as making plans about eating
  behavior, has been related to a healthier diet. The present study investigated
  whether nutrition knowledge, food preferences, and habit strength for healthy
  and unhealthy eating moderate these relationships. In total, 1245 participants
  took part in a preregistered cross-sectional online survey. Results revealed
  that neither nutrition knowledge, nor liking of healthy or unhealthy foods,
  nor habit strength for healthy or unhealthy eating interacted with the
  preference for intuition or deliberation in eating decision-making in
  affecting dietary intake (βs ≤ |.06|; ts ≤ |2.11|; ps ≥ .035). Instead,
  including the potential moderating variables in analyses rendered the effect
  of a preference for intuition largely non-significant. In contrast, the
  positive effect of a preference for deliberation was largely stable even when
  including the potential moderating variables. Thus, the present study confirms
  the general health-promoting effect of a preference for deliberation in eating
  decision-making. In contrast, results speak in favor of a generally minor role
  of a preference for intuition for healthy or unhealthy eating.
