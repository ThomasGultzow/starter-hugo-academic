abstract: Having intrinsic or self-determined motivation in contrast to
  controlled motivation has proved to result in better learning and health
  behavior adoption and maintenance. Intrinsic or self-determined motivation can
  be enhanced by satisfying the need for autonomy. Therefore, this study
  investigated if adolescents’ (1) intrinsic motivation to learn about safe sex
  and (2) self-determined motivation to perform safe sex would be higher when an
  online message about safe sex is presented in autonomy-supportive language
  (implying choice) compared to controlling language (pressuring and commanding
  tone). Furthermore, this study also investigated if adolescents’ (1) intrinsic
  motivation to learn about safe sex and (2) self-determined motivation to
  perform safe sex changes depending on whether the online message is written by
  someone that is similar to them, in comparison to when this message is written
  by someone that is not similar to them. To this end, a 2 (autonomy-supportive
  language vs. controlling language) by 2 (identification vs. no identification)
  experimental study (N = 204) was conducted using a website page about safe sex
  from the Dutch sexual health website sense.info. Even though we found some
  indications of the expected effects, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
  showed no significant difference for either autonomy-supportive language,
  identification, or an interaction of both strategies. However, we found some
  preliminary evidence that this could be due to a ceiling effect. We therefore
  recommend further exploring these strategies, taking into account some lessons
  learned.
