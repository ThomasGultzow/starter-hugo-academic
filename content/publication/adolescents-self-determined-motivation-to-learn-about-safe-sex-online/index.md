abstract: Self-determined motivation fosters better learning and sustained
  health behaviour adoption than controlled motivation. Self-determined
  motivation can be strengthened by satisfying the need for autonomy. Therefore,
  this study investigated if adolescents’ (1) intrinsic motivation to learn
  about safer sex and (2) self-determined motivation to perform safer sex would
  be higher when an online message is presented in autonomy-supportive language
  compared to controlling language. Furthermore, this study also investigated if
  adolescents’ (1) intrinsic motivation to learn about safer sex and (2)
  self-determined motivation to perform safer sex changes depending on whether
  the online message is written by someone that is similar to them. To this end,
  a 2 (autonomy-supportive language vs. controlling language) x 2
  (identification vs. no identification) experimental study (N = 214) was
  conducted using a website page about safe sex from the Dutch sexual health
  website sense.info. Even though we found some indications of the expected
  effects, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed no significant
  difference for either autonomy-supportive language, identification, or an
  interaction of both strategies. However, we found some preliminary evidence
  that this could be due to a ceiling effect. We therefore recommend further
  exploring these strategies, considering some lessons learned.
