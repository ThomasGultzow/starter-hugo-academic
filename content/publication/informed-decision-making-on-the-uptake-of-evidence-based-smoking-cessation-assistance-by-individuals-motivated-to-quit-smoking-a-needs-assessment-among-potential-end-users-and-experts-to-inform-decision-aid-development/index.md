abstract: "Evidence-based cessation assistance increases cessation rates.
  Activating preferences during decision making could improve effectiveness
  further. Decision aids (DAs) facilitate deciding by taking preferences into
  account. To develop effective DAs, potential end users' (i.e., individuals
  motivated to quit) needs and experts' viewpoints should be considered.
  Therefore, the aim of this needs assessment was: (1) To explore end users'
  needs and (2) to obtain consensus among smoking cessation counsellors and
  scientific experts to develop a self-administered DA to support end users in
  choosing cessation assistance. Data was gathered via two approaches: (1)
  twenty semi-structured interviews with potential end users and (2) two
  three-round Delphi studies with 61 counsellors and 44 scientific experts.
  Interview data and the first Delphi rounds were analysed qualitatively, the
  other Delphi rounds were analysed quantitatively. Potential end users acquired
  information in different ways, e.g., via own experiences. Important
  characteristics to decide between tools varied, however effectiveness and
  costs were commonly reported. Experts reached consensus on 38 and 40
  statements, e.g., tools should be appropriate for users' addiction level.
  Although some trends emerged, due to the variation among stakeholders, a 'one
  size fits all'-approach is undesirable. This heterogeneity should be
  considered, e.g., by enabling users to customise the DA."
