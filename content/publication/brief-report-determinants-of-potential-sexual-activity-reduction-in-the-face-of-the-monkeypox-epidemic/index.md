abstract: The current monkeypox epidemic is most prevalent among
  men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). Vaccination programs are being rolled-out to
  curb the epidemic. Behavioural measures have been called for as well, e.g., by
  the WHO to reduce the number of sexual partners and sexual activity. We
  investigated intentions and determinants among Dutch MSM to follow such
  measures. Early July 2022, 394 MSM answered an online questionnaire. The
  overall intentions to reduce number of partners and sexual activity was high,
  but only a minority had developed definite intentions. Determinant analysis
  revealed that dating/open relationship status was a positive predictor,
  vaccination intentions did not predict sexual behaviour change; those not on
  PrEP were more likely to change their sexual behaviour. Monkeypox infection
  concern was negatively related to weaker intentions and only predicted
  definite intentions. Our results show that additional public health measures
  are necessary to reach and convince MSM to engage in sexual behaviour change.
