abstract: Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease and leads to a smallpox-like disease
  in humans. The current epidemic in European countries requires informed
  responses. We investigated the ability to self-diagnose a potential infection,
  and determinants of vaccination and self-isolation intention after diagnosis
  among 394 MSM in the Netherlands. We found that about half were able to
  self-diagnose monkeypox, that 70% had a high intention to get vaccinated and
  44% to self-isolate after monkeypox diagnosis. Determinants went beyond mere
  risk behaviour criteria.
