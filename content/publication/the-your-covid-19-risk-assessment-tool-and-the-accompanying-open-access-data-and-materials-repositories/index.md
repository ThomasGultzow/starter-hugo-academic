abstract: In March 2020, the Your COVID-19 Risk tool was developed in response
  to the global spread of SARS-CoV-2. The tool is an online resource based on
  key behavioural evidence-based risk factors related to contracting and
  spreading SARS-CoV-2. This article describes the development of the tool, the
  produced resources, the associated open repository, and initial results. This
  tool was developed by a multidisciplinary research team consisting of more
  than 150 international experts. This project leverages knowledge obtained in
  behavioural science, aiming to promote behaviour change by assessing risk and
  supporting individuals completing the assessment tool to protect themselves
  and others from infection. To enable iterative improvements of the tool, tool
  users can optionally answer questions about behavioural determinants. The data
  and results are openly shared to support governments and health agencies
  developing behaviour change interventions. Over 60 000 users in more than 150
  countries have assessed their risk and provided data.
