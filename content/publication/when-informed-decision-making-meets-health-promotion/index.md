abstract: This dissertation had two main goals. The first goal was to learn more
  about so-called decision aids that are used to help users make decisions
  related to improving their own health. It was found that, while these tools
  can help people, we still need to learn more about what really helps in
  decision making. The dissertation makes a first contribution to this. The
  second goal was to develop a digital decision aid to help smokers decide how
  they want to quit smoking. This decision aid was developed together with
  smokers and other experts. Furthermore, it was examined who finds such a
  decision aid interesting and from which part of the decision aid users benefit
  the most. It was found that, although many people are interested in such a
  digital decision aid, more research needs to be done into what ensures that
  users continue to use the decision aid and do not stop halfway through.
