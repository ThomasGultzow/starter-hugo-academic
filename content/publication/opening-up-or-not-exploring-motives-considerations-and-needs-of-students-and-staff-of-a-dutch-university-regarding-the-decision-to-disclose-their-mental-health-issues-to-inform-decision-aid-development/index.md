abstract: Mental health disclosure decisions can be difficult, especially within
  universities. University students and staff might benefit from decision
  support. Therefore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff
  (n=10) and students (n=10), including participants who decided to (not)
  disclose. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire including
  the SURE test. Subsequently, they were interviewed about the decision to
  disclose and their needs regarding a disclosure decision aid. Data from the
  SURE test was analyzed based on descriptives, interviews were analyzed using
  the Framework–method. Most students (n=9) decided not to disclose, whereas
  most staff (n=8) did. Both students and staff described advantages and
  disadvantages of disclosing. Advantages included support, relief,
  understanding, and safety, but there were also risks, such as stigmatization
  and career concerns. Not disclosing can prevent unwanted questions but can
  also lead to misunderstandings. In short, disclosing offers opportunities and
  risks. Regarding decision support, both students and staff preferred a brief
  online tool. Both students and staff encounter challenges when it comes to
  deciding whether to disclose their mental health status. A decision aid can
  serve as a valuable tool to assist them in making informed decisions and
  preparing for potential conversations related to mental health disclosure.
