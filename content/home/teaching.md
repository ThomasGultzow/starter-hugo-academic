Currently I am co-examiner of courses focused on qualitative research and health psychology, review reports within other method-focused courses and develop a course focused on behaviour and climate change. I also have (among other things) teaching experience in:

- Development, implementation, and evaluation of (behaviour change) interventions
- Health promotion
- Behavior (change) theories
- Self-regulation
- Research methods
- Anxiety disorders
- Thesis supervision

In 2021, I obtained my Basiskwalificatie Onderwijs (BKO) / Dutch University Teaching Qualification (UTQ).
