I am currently supervising several master's students in health and social psychology on topics at the intersection of sexual health and decision making. I also have (among other things) teaching experience in:

- Development, implementation and evaluation of (behavior change) interventions
- Health promotion
- Behavior (change) theories
- Self-regulation
- Research methods
- Anxiety disorders

In 2021 I obtained my Basiskwalificatie Onderwijs (BKO) / University Teaching Qualification (UTQ).
