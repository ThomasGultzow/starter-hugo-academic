I am a researcher in the field of (health) behaviour and I am passionate about empowering people to make informed decisions about their health, well-being, and societal issues. My expertise lies in understanding how informed decision making influences behaviour and optimising (digital) tools to support both informed decision making as well as autonomous behaviour change. I also research how communication ‚Äì both online and offline ‚Äì influences decision-making processes and behaviour. As an advocate of transparency and trust in science, I strive to make research accessible and useful. In addition, I am an experienced teacher. From being a tutor to coordinating courses, I've helped students develop skills that go beyond the classroom.

Before I started working as a researcher, I worked as a paediatric nurse in Germany.

I am also currently the chair of the [Digital Health & Computer-Tailoring Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://ehps.net/digital-health-and-computer-tailoring/)üë®‚Äçüíª of the [European Health Psychology Society (EHPS)](https://ehps.net/).
