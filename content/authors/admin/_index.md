I am a passionate researcher in the field of behaviour and decision making, specialising in informed decision making, behaviour change, and the influence of digital communication and interventions. My focus spans a variety of topics, ranging from sexual and reproductive health to the disclosure of mental health issues and climate change. In essence, anything related to behaviour and decision making, as well as its support, captures my interest. Additionally, I am a strong advocate for social justice, aiming to ensure that everyone is visible in research. I actively work to integrate these principles into our research to promote an inclusive approach. In addition, I am an experienced teacher. From being a tutor to coordinating courses, I've helped students develop skills that go beyond the classroom.

Before I started working as a researcher, I worked as a paediatric nurse in Germany.

I am also currently the chair of the [Digital Health & Computer-Tailoring Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://ehps.net/digital-health-and-computer-tailoring/)👨‍💻 and co-chair and founder of the [European network for postdoctoral early career & Mid-career researchers in health PsychOlogy focusing on Well-being & Empowerment of Researchers (EMPOWER)]([https://ehps.net/digital-health-and-computer-tailoring/](https://ehps.net/about-empower/))💪 of the [European Health Psychology Society (EHPS)](https://ehps.net/) and editor-in-chief of the [European Health Psychologist](https://www.ehps.net/ehp/index.php/contents/index) 📰
